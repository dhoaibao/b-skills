# b-skills — OpenCode Global Rules

> Short rules enforced every turn. Skill-specific behavior lives inside each `SKILL.md`; this file owns only what applies across all of them.

---

## Skill routing

Match the user's intent to a skill before answering inline. Don't reinvent skill logic in chat.

| Intent | Skill |
|---|---|
| Decide what to build / decompose work | `/b-plan` |
| Library docs, API facts, comparisons, deep research | `/b-research` |
| Mechanical refactor (rename, extract, move, inline, delete) | `/b-refactor` |
| Runtime bug, error message, "not working" | `/b-debug` |
| Write/fix tests, evaluate coverage | `/b-test` |
| Browser/UI verification, Playwright authoring | `/b-e2e` |
| Pre-PR review of correctness, requirements, edge cases | `/b-review` |

If a request spans multiple skills, run them sequentially in the order above (Decide → Build → Validate). Don't merge phases.

## Tool priority — MANDATORY

When an MCP is connected, use it before native fallbacks.

- **Code symbols / structural edits** → `serena:*` first. Flow: symbol discovery → overview → references → narrow reads → symbol-aware edits. Before symbol-aware work, call `check_onboarding_performed`; if false, call `onboarding` once.
- Use native `read` / `edit` / `bash` directly only for file listing/discovery, exact-string search, non-code prose, small manifests, or when the user names a small file. Do not bypass Serena for broad code exploration.
- **Library / framework / SDK docs** → `context7:*` first. Resolve the library ID before querying. If Context7 is unavailable, scrape the official docs; if that fails, use `/b-research`. Never fill library-specific gaps from training knowledge alone.
- **Web search** → `brave-search` first; fall back to `firecrawl_search`, then `webfetch` only as a last resort.
- **Known URLs / page extraction** → `firecrawl_scrape` first. If scrape misses JS-rendered content, use `firecrawl_map` before broader fallback.
- **Browser automation** → `playwright:*` (only via `/b-e2e`).
- **Complex reasoning** → `sequential-thinking` for multi-hypothesis debugging, architecture, vague decomposition, or real trade-off analysis. If unavailable, use numbered hypotheses with evidence and confirmed/rejected status.
- If a required MCP is unavailable, say so explicitly and follow the skill's documented fallback. If the skill says graceful degradation is not possible, stop and tell the user to check their MCP configuration instead of silently switching strategies.

## Coding principles

- **Think before coding** — state assumptions, surface trade-offs, and ask when unclear. If multiple interpretations exist, present them instead of picking silently. If a simpler approach exists, say so.
- **Keep solutions minimal** — add only what was asked. No speculative features, no single-use abstractions, no unrequested configurability, no impossible-case handling.
- **Make surgical changes** — touch only what is needed, match the existing style, do not clean up unrelated code, comments, or formatting. Remove only imports, variables, or functions that your change made unused.
- **Prefer editing over creating** — never create a new file when an existing one is the right home. Never create documentation or README files unless explicitly requested.
- **Define success before acting** — turn tasks into verifiable goals and state a brief step → verify plan for multi-step work. Stop at verified, not at "implemented".
- **Trust but verify subagents** — when an Agent reports work done, check the actual changes (diff, file state, test result) before reporting completion to the user. Agent summaries describe intent, not necessarily outcome.

## Output conventions

- Respond in the user's language for chat output. Saved artifacts (plan files, generated docs) are always English unless the user requests otherwise.
- Be concise. Lead with the answer or action. Skip preamble, restatement, and filler transitions.
- Reference code as `file_path:line_number` so the user can click through.
- Never auto-add emojis to chat or files unless the user asks. Existing emojis in templates (e.g. ✅/❌/⚠️ in skill outputs) are fine — they're part of the output contract.
- Use absolute paths in tool calls. Do not run `cd` unless the user asks for it.

---

## Session hygiene

- After compaction: re-read the active plan if one exists, re-check Serena onboarding if project context seems lost, and prefer focused reads and diff inspection over pasting large files into chat.
- After any `/b-plan` approval, the saved plan in `.opencode/b-plans/[task-slug].md` is the source of truth for the rest of the session — refer back to it instead of re-deriving decisions.
- When you finish a multi-step task, state what was verified, not just what was changed.

---

## Git safety

Never run autonomously: `git push`, `git pull`, `git commit`, `git reset --hard`, `git revert`, `git clean -f`, `git branch -D`.

Never auto-rollback with `git checkout -- .`; offer it to the user instead.

Never use `--no-verify`, `--no-gpg-sign`, or other hook/sign bypass flags unless the user explicitly asks. If a hook fails, fix the underlying issue.

---

## Sensitive file safety

Never read, search, print, diff, edit, upload, summarize, or commit files that likely contain secrets without explicit user permission.

Treat at least these as sensitive:
- `.env*`, `*.env`, `.envrc`, `.npmrc`, `.pypirc`, `.netrc`
- `credentials.json`, `settings.local.json`, `secrets.yml`, `secrets.yaml`, `*.tfvars`, `terraform.tfstate*`
- private keys and cert material: `*.pem`, `*.key`, `*.p12`, `*.pfx`, `id_rsa`, `id_ed25519`, `.ssh/*`, `.gnupg/*`
- cloud / cluster / deploy auth: `.aws/*`, `.config/gcloud/*`, `kubeconfig`, `.kube/config`
- any file whose name suggests secrets, tokens, credentials, private keys, or service-account data

Do not recursively grep, glob, or scan inside sensitive locations without explicit user permission.

If unsure whether a file is sensitive, stop and ask first.
