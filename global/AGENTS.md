# b-skills — OpenCode Runtime Contract

> Shared runtime rules for routing, tool choice, safety, evidence, outputs, and handoffs. Skills should reference this file instead of duplicating policy.

---

## 1. Routing

Match the user's intent to one active skill before acting. If a request spans phases, sequence `Clarify -> Decide -> Build -> Validate`.

| Intent | Skill |
|---|---|
| Clarify what to build, lock goals/constraints | `/b-spec` |
| Decide how to build, decompose work | `/b-plan` |
| External docs, API facts, comparisons | `/b-research` |
| Execute approved or clearly scoped work | `/b-implement` |
| Mechanical rename, extract, move, inline, delete | `/b-refactor` |
| Runtime bug, error, "not working" | `/b-debug` |
| Unit/integration tests, coverage, failing tests | `/b-test` |
| Browser/UI verification or browser-driven flow testing | `/b-e2e` |
| Pre-PR changed-code review | `/b-review` |

### Trigger precedence (when intents overlap)

- Browser-driven flow testing beats `b-test`; use `b-e2e`.
- A failing test that likely exposes a real product bug beats `b-test`; use `b-debug`. See §10.
- A named behavior-preserving rename/extract/move beats `b-implement`; use `b-refactor`.
- Unclear user goal, end state, or acceptance criteria beats `b-plan`; use `b-spec`.
- Unclear implementation approach or sequencing with a clear goal beats `b-implement`; use `b-plan`.
- `b-research` is for genuine external-knowledge blockers, not for questions the codebase or repo docs can answer locally.
- DOM-rendered unit tests (jsdom, React Testing Library, Vue Test Utils) stay in `b-test`; only real browser navigation goes to `b-e2e`.

### One active skill

Keep one active skill until its stop condition is hit. Do not switch skills for optional enrichment or minor lookups that the current skill can finish with bounded evidence.

### Mid-flow switch policy

- A new request mid-flow does **not** auto-cancel the active skill. State the conflict in one line, ask the user whether to pause, queue, or abandon, then proceed.
- An explicit `/<skill>` command from the user always overrides. Emit a handoff envelope (§9) before switching.
- A required sub-task (e.g., a research blocker discovered during `b-implement`) is a handoff, not a parallel run. Pause, hand off, resume — never both skills active.
- **Concurrency adjudication.** If the active skill is mid-iteration-cap (§7) or mid-transform (`b-implement` / `b-refactor`), the default is **queue** — finish the current verified step, emit a status block, then switch. If the active skill is mid-discovery only (no edits yet), the default is **pause**. The user may override either default; if they do, record the override in the handoff envelope.

### Clarification budget

Ask at most **2 clarification rounds** unless a real decision gate still blocks safe progress.

### Localized trigger phrases

Match intent regardless of language. The phrases below are routing aids only; do not duplicate them inside individual skill descriptions.

| Skill | English triggers | Vietnamese triggers |
|---|---|---|
| `/b-spec` | clarify, requirements, scope, rough idea, "what exactly should we build" | làm rõ, yêu cầu, phạm vi, ý tưởng thô, chưa rõ cần gì |
| `/b-plan` | plan, design, decompose, approach, "how should I" | lập kế hoạch, thiết kế, hướng tiếp cận, chia nhỏ |
| `/b-research` | docs, library, API, compare, look up, "what is" | tra cứu, tài liệu, so sánh, tìm hiểu |
| `/b-implement` | implement, add, build, execute, finish, ship | triển khai, thực hiện, viết code, hoàn thành |
| `/b-refactor` | rename, extract, move, inline, delete, cleanup | đổi tên, tách, di chuyển, xoá, dọn dẹp |
| `/b-debug` | bug, broken, error, stack trace, "not working", regression | lỗi, hỏng, không chạy, sai, truy vết |
| `/b-test` | tests, coverage, failing test, snapshot, mock | kiểm thử, viết test, độ bao phủ, mock |
| `/b-e2e` | E2E, browser, UI flow, Playwright, navigate | trình duyệt, UI, end-to-end, kiểm thử giao diện |
| `/b-review` | review, PR, lint, pre-PR, "what would a reviewer" | rà soát, review, kiểm tra trước PR |

Ignore legacy or alternate skill trees that do not match the installed runtime contract unless the user explicitly asks to inspect or edit them.

## 2. Source of truth and plan lifecycle

### Conflict ladder

Use this order when instructions compete:
1. User's latest explicit instruction.
2. Approved saved plan in `.opencode/b-skills/b-plan/<task-slug>.md`.
3. Approved chat plan.
4. Current repository evidence.
5. Conventional defaults recorded as assumptions.

After `/b-plan` approval, the approved plan becomes the execution source of truth for multi-step implementation.

### Durable plan metadata

New saved plans should start with YAML frontmatter so approval and staleness are durable instead of inferred from chat history:

```yaml
---
slug: <task-slug>
status: draft | approved | in-progress | complete | superseded
created_at: <YYYY-MM-DD>
approved_at: <YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ | null>
approved_by: user | null
approved_head: <git-sha | null>
risk: trivial | low | medium | high
touch_points:
  - <path>
---
```

When the user approves a saved plan, update `status`, `approved_at`, `approved_by`, and `approved_head` in place when the repo has a git HEAD. `approved` and `in-progress` are executable approved states; `draft`, `complete`, and `superseded` require explicit current-chat approval or a plan revision before further edits. Legacy plans without frontmatter may still be executed when the current conversation contains explicit approval; use the approval time from chat for staleness checks and do not rewrite legacy plans solely to add metadata.

### Plan staleness gate

A saved plan is stale if any of these are true:
- A file listed under `touch_points` frontmatter or `Planned touch points` has been modified since approval. Prefer checking both committed drift (`git diff --name-only <approved_head>..HEAD -- <touch_points>`) and current working-tree drift (`git diff --name-only <approved_head> -- <touch_points>`) when `approved_head` exists; otherwise use mtime or git history from `approved_at` / current-chat approval time.
- A `Confirmed decision` conflicts with the current repo state.
- The git HEAD has moved past a rebase/merge that touches planned files.

A stale plan must be re-planned, not improvised against.

### Plan revision protocol

When the user asks to revise an approved plan, or `b-implement` discovers the plan is wrong mid-execution:

1. Edit the plan file **in place** — never write `plan-v2.md`.
2. Append a `## Revisions` section if not present, then add one entry: `- YYYY-MM-DD — <one-line delta>`.
3. Re-request approval if the revision touches `Confirmed decisions`, `Planned touch points`, or `Steps`. Cosmetic edits do not need re-approval.
4. After approval, restart from the earliest step affected by the revision.

### Do not invent

Do not invent product behavior, acceptance criteria, compatibility promises, or naming decisions. Ask instead.

### Optional domain docs convention

- When a repo already has `CONTEXT.md` or `CONTEXT-MAP.md`, treat it as the project's glossary and bounded-context map, not as an implementation spec.
- When wording, naming, or user intent is ambiguous, prefer the canonical terms from those files and consult nearby ADRs before inventing new terminology.
- Create or update domain docs only when the active skill explicitly owns that work. Do not create glossary or ADR files as a side effect of ordinary implementation.

---

## 3. Definitions and rubrics

The single glossary all skills defer to. Do not redefine these terms inside individual skill files.

### Non-trivial work

A change is **non-trivial** if any is true:
- Touches more than 3 files.
- Touches a public contract (exported API, route, CLI flag, schema, migration).
- Touches a sensitive path (auth, authz, billing, secrets, crypto, persistence migrations).
- Adds, removes, or changes a dependency.
- Modifies CI, build, or release configuration.

Otherwise the change is **trivial** and may use the lightweight paths in each skill.

### Small direct request

A request that may bypass `/b-plan` and go straight to `/b-implement` must meet **all** of:
- 3 or fewer files.
- No exported/public contract change.
- No sensitive path (auth, security, billing, migration).
- No remaining design decision; behavior is obvious from the request.

Anything failing this threshold goes back to `/b-plan`.

### Severity rubric (`/b-review`, `/b-debug`, any finding)

| Severity | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **BLOCKER** | Correctness, security, data-loss, or contract violation. Cannot ship. |
| **MAJOR** | Likely regression, missing coverage on changed behavior, or operability gap in a new entry point. Should fix before PR. |
| **MINOR** | Bug-prone code, edge case, or follow-up cleanup that does not block the PR. |
| **NIT** | Style, naming, or preference. Authors may ignore. |

### Risk rubric (`/b-refactor`, `/b-implement`, verification depth)

| Risk | Criteria |
|---|---|
| **trivial** | One file, no exported change, few or no external references, behavior preserved. |
| **low** | Single module, internal refs only, narrow tests cover the area. |
| **medium** | Multi-file, exported/shared symbol, or partial test coverage. |
| **high** | Public contract, schema, migration, auth/security/billing path, or known broad blast radius. |

Match verification depth to the risk band per the verification ladder (§7).

### Confidence signal

When an answer rests on incomplete evidence, end with one line:

`Confidence: high | medium | low — <one-clause reason>.`

- **high** = direct evidence (runtime, primary docs, symbol bodies). Omit the line entirely.
- **medium** = consistent secondary evidence.
- **low** = single weak source, snippet only, or material gap.

Skip the line on trivial high-confidence answers (a single docs lookup with a direct hit) to avoid ceremony. Always include it on partial, single-source, or recency-sensitive answers.

---

## 4. Tool model

### Tool priority

Use the lightest reliable tool. Native Glob/Grep/Read/Bash stay first for exact strings, manifests, prose, config, and commands.

| Task shape | First choice | Then narrow with |
|---|---|---|
| Graph overview, architecture, blast radius, changed-scope validation | `gitnexus-radar` when indexed, fresh, target-aware | `serena-symbol-toolkit` |
| Exact symbol discovery, declarations, references, symbol edits | `serena-symbol-toolkit` | Native tools + `apply_patch` |
| Library/framework docs | `context7-docs` | `/b-research` |
| Web search | `brave-discovery` | `firecrawl-extraction` |
| Known URL extraction | `firecrawl-extraction` | `firecrawl-extended`, then `firecrawl-deep` (approval) |
| Local document extraction | `firecrawl-extraction` (`firecrawl_parse`) | `firecrawl-extraction` (`firecrawl_scrape`) only if already hosted |
| Browser automation | `playwright-browser` via `/b-e2e` | none |

### Radar/hands boundary

GitNexus is optional radar; Serena is primary hands. GitNexus scopes graph risk, flows, routes, consumers, and cross-module impact. Serena confirms exact symbols, bodies, references, and performs symbol-aware edits.

### GitNexus freshness gate

Rely on GitNexus only when the repo is indexed, not stale, and the target file or symbol is represented. If unavailable, stale, unindexed, missing FTS, or missing the target, warn once and continue with Serena or native tools. If a GitNexus result references a file whose mtime is newer than the index timestamp, treat the result as stale. Stale graph output is not evidence.

### Tool selection rules

- Single-file or local-only task: skip GitNexus.
- Known symbol edit: Serena first; GitNexus only for exported/shared or cross-boundary symbols.
- Large unfamiliar area: one GitNexus pass to narrow, then Serena confirms.
- Do not use GitNexus and Serena in parallel on the same exact symbol hunt.
- Do not escalate to a second MCP when the first authoritative source already answered.
- Pick the cheapest discovery tool that closes the next question; there is no required ordering among Serena discovery tools.

### MCP bundles

Skills reference bundles by name instead of repeating tool lists.

#### `serena-symbol-toolkit`

- **Server:** `serena`
- **Session init:** once per session, only when symbol-aware work first becomes necessary: `check_onboarding_performed`, then `onboarding` if needed.
- **Discovery:** `find_symbol`, `get_symbols_overview`, `find_referencing_symbols`, `find_declaration`, `find_implementations`, `search_for_pattern`.
- **Verification:** `get_diagnostics_for_file`.
- **Edits:** `replace_symbol_body`, `insert_before_symbol`, `insert_after_symbol`, `rename_symbol`, `safe_delete_symbol`.
- **LSP caveat:** strong for TS/JS, Python, and similar; weak for Bash, YAML, Markdown, Lua, and many DSLs. Treat non-LSP renames/safe-deletes/diagnostics as **not authoritative**; widen verification.

#### `gitnexus-radar`

- **Server:** `gitnexus`
- **Role:** optional graph radar for scoping blast radius, route/consumer surfaces, or unfamiliar architecture.
- **Use only when** indexed, fresh, and the target is represented.
- **Never use for** symbol editing, exact-body inspection, or anything Serena can answer directly.

#### `context7-docs`

- **Server:** `context7`
- **Tools:** `resolve-library-id`, `query-docs`.
- **Version pinning:** before querying, pin from manifests **and lockfiles** (`package-lock.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `yarn.lock`, `poetry.lock`, `uv.lock`, `go.sum`, `Cargo.lock`, etc.). In monorepos, use the closest workspace. Ask when versions conflict.
- **Fallback:** if Context7 cannot answer, prefer the library's own documentation URL pattern (e.g., `<library>.dev/docs/`) over generic web search.

#### `brave-discovery`

- **Server:** `brave-search`
- **Tools:** `brave_web_search`.
- **Role:** page discovery only. Pass discovered URLs to `firecrawl-extraction` for content.
- `brave_news_search` / `brave_image_search` are outside the bundle; use only when news or visual evidence is explicit.

#### `firecrawl-extraction` (default tier)

- **Server:** `firecrawl`
- **Tools:** `firecrawl_scrape`, `firecrawl_parse`.
- **Use for:** content extraction from a known URL or local document.

#### `firecrawl-extended` (conditional tier)

- **Tools:** `firecrawl_map`, `firecrawl_extract`.
- **Use only when** mapping a site's structure or extracting structured fields (prices, params, tables). Do not reach for these on plain content.

#### `firecrawl-deep` (last-resort tier, requires explicit user approval)

- **Tools:** `firecrawl_interact`, `firecrawl_agent`.
- **Cost warning:** can run for minutes and burn substantial credit. Exhaust lower tiers, then get approval per invocation by default. A user may grant a run-scoped, capped pre-authorization in lieu of per-invocation asks; see "Tool-use heuristics" in this section for the exact rules.

#### `playwright-browser`

- **Server:** `playwright` MCP (preferred when available).
- **Fallback:** local Playwright CLI via Bash (`npx playwright …`) when already installed.
- **Tools used in skill prose:** snapshot, navigate, click, type/fill/select, hover, drag/drop/upload, dialogs, tabs, wait, resize, screenshot, evaluate, network, console, close.
- **Restricted:** any `*_unsafe` tool requires explicit approval per invocation.

#### Sequential-thinking

Bundled but optional. Use only when **three or more** plausible hypotheses remain with equal cheapest-verification cost.

### MCP availability and fallback ladder

Assume bundles are available; do not preflight. On failure, retry once narrower, then fall back and label the limitation.

**Fallback ladder:**
- `serena-symbol-toolkit` unavailable → native Glob/Grep/Read + `apply_patch`. Treat renames and safe-deletes as high-risk; widen verification.
- `gitnexus-radar` unavailable, stale, or missing target → continue without graph evidence; do not retry.
- `context7-docs` unavailable → official-docs URL via `brave-discovery` + `firecrawl-extraction`.
- `firecrawl-extraction` unavailable → search snippets only; mark answer as snippet-only with `Confidence: low`.
- `playwright-browser` MCP unavailable → local Playwright CLI if installed; otherwise stop and tell the user browser automation is unavailable.

### Fallback labeling

When fallback changes the intended tool path, evidence source, or verification route, tag the affected step or finding as `[degraded: <reason>]`.

### Tool-use heuristics

- Around **12 MCP calls** in one skill run, pause and summarize remaining unknowns before more discovery.
- Do not open a second tool-heavy thread until the current investigation, edit, or verification thread is closed or the user asks to expand scope.
- If sustained tool use is not increasing evidence quality, narrow the next check or stop and ask whether to continue.
- Classify failures before retry/fallback: unavailable, auth/permission, rate-limit, timeout, stale index/cache, unsupported content, malformed request. Retry only transient or fixable-by-narrowing failures; stop for auth failures.
- `firecrawl-deep` invocations require user approval **per invocation by default**. **Run-scoped pre-authorization carve-out:** the per-invocation default may be relaxed only when the user issues an explicit, scoped grant (e.g., "approved: use deep mode up to 3 times for this research pass") that names **both** (a) a numeric invocation cap and (b) the current run. Without an explicit cap, the carve-out is invalid and the per-invocation rule still applies. Record the granted cap in the status block `notes` and the handoff envelope `carve-outs` field; decrement on each use and surface the remaining count in the next status block. The carve-out expires when the run ends, when the cap is exhausted, or when the user revokes it — whichever comes first. The carve-out never overrides §6 safety gates (privacy, sensitive files, destructive actions).
- `gitnexus-radar` should usually stay to 1-2 calls per run; more often means the question should move back to Serena or native tools.
- Reuse recently fetched URLs, docs, and symbol results instead of re-fetching them.
- The verification iteration cap (§7) still applies.

### Run cost signal

When a non-trivial run consumes notable budget, include a one-line cost summary in the status block `notes` field:

`cost: gitnexus=2, serena=14, context7=1, firecrawl-deep=1, iterations=2/3`

Only include counters that were actually used. Skip entirely on trivial runs. This lets the next skill in a chain see whether to slow down before adding more tool work.

### Global bundle/path guards (runtime, not just maintainer norm)

- A skill **must not** invent a new MCP bundle name. Every bundle reference must resolve to a definition in this section.
- A skill **must not** write to a path outside §8. If a use case needs a new path, surface it as a `needs-input` blocker rather than picking one ad hoc.
- A skill **must not** redefine an approval template, fallback label, iteration cap, severity, risk, confidence signal, slug algorithm, run-id format, manifest schema, status block, or handoff envelope. Reference the canonical section.

---

## 5. Evidence standards

Evidence hierarchy: **runtime** (tests, builds, logs, browser/network) > **symbol** (Serena bodies, declarations, references, diagnostics, edits) > **graph** (GitNexus routes, processes, impact, consumers) > **text** (exact native matches) > **search snippets** (triage only).

Graph evidence helps review/exploration but does not prove edits are safe. Stale graph output is not evidence (see §4 freshness gate). Search snippets are discovery only; if they are the final source after fallbacks, label snippet-only with `Confidence: low` and name the missing primary source or extraction step.

When two authoritative sources disagree (e.g., two versions of vendor docs), prefer the one matching the pinned version (§4); if still ambiguous, present both with the conflict labeled and a `Confidence: medium` line.

When final evidence is weaker than runtime or symbol evidence, attach the §3 confidence signal.

### Documentation-backed decisions

When framework, library, or vendor API docs materially influence an implementation or review conclusion, cite the supporting source in the relevant output or finding.

- Do not add citations for purely local code changes or obvious language semantics.
- One narrow authoritative lookup is enough; this rule does not force a separate research pass when the current skill already resolved the question.
- **Citation provenance.** Every cited URL must come from a result the agent actually fetched in this session (via `context7-docs`, `brave-discovery`, `firecrawl-extraction`, or a user-supplied URL). Do not cite URLs from memory. If the supporting page is from memory and was not re-fetched, either fetch it now or label the claim as `Confidence: low — uncited recall`.

### Token budget

Keep runtime prose short. Preserve explicit safety gates, schemas, routing boundaries, and verification requirements; compress examples, duplicated rationale, and restated global concepts into § references.

---

## 6. Safety gates

### Approval-required actions

Approval required before installs, dev servers, migrations, destructive commands, production/staging-like writes, broad refactors, commits, or shared-environment mutation.

### Command risk classes

Classify commands before running them so approval gates are consistent:

- **read-only** — inspect files/git/deps or run non-mutating diagnostics. No approval unless sensitive files would be read.
- **project-write** — edit approved source, tests, docs, generated artifacts, or local config.
- **dependency-write** — install/remove/update deps or regenerate lockfiles. Requires approval.
- **environment-write** — start/stop servers, containers, emulators, DBs, jobs, or persisted-auth browser sessions. Requires approval when long-lived or mutating.
- **external-write** — mutate APIs, staging/prod, queues, payments, email/SMS, or analytics. Requires approval naming the environment.
- **destructive** — delete data/files/branches, reset state, rewrite history, clean worktrees, or drop DBs. Requires explicit approval and never targets unrelated user work.

### Canonical approval ask

Use a single template so users see consistent ask shape across skills:

```text
[approval] <action in imperative form>
Effect: <blast radius and any mutation>
Proceed? (y/n)
```

Example: `[approval] Run pnpm install — Effect: writes node_modules and updates pnpm-lock.yaml. Proceed? (y/n)`

### Public web privacy gate

- Never send private stack traces, internal URLs, customer data, secrets, or proprietary code to public web tools without explicit approval.
- Sanitize queries when a sanitized form can answer the question.
- If sanitizing would remove the essential signal, stop and ask.

Skills do not restate this. They reference §6.

### Sensitive file safety

- Never read, search, print, diff, edit, upload, summarize, or commit likely-secret files (e.g., `.env`, `*.pem`, `credentials.*`, `secrets.*`) without explicit permission.
- If unsure whether a file is sensitive, stop and ask.

### Repo-local artifact safety

- Saved plans under `.opencode/b-skills/b-plan/` are canonical source-of-truth files, not runtime artifacts; do not reroute them.
- Before any suite write under repo-local `.opencode/`, including saved plans, ensure the root ignore guard: create `.opencode/.gitignore` containing `*` when `.opencode/` or that file is missing; leave an existing `.opencode/.gitignore` unchanged.
- Do not store auth/session state or other sensitive run artifacts under repo-local `.opencode/` unless the user explicitly opts into repo-local persistence. Use `~/.config/opencode/b-skills/...` or `/tmp/opencode/b-skills/...` instead by default.
- Persisting reusable browser auth/session state requires explicit opt-in, even outside the worktree; otherwise use ephemeral/current-run state only.
- Never store real browser auth/session state under a tracked worktree path.

### Generated files and lockfiles

- Treat generated, vendored, minified, snapshot, golden, and lock files as derived unless explicitly requested or required.
- Update lockfiles only after approved dependency-write.
- Update snapshots/goldens only after stating intended behavior and citing the source change or product decision (§10).
- Prefer changing generator sources; if unavailable, label manual generated updates as partial evidence.

### Worktree safety

- Check dirty state before non-trivial edits.
- Preserve unrelated user changes.
- If a target file already has unrelated edits, patch around them.
- If user changes directly conflict with the task, stop and ask.

### Isolated workspace preference

- For non-trivial build, refactor, or debug work, prefer an isolated workspace or linked worktree when the current tree is dirty enough to interfere, the task touches public contracts or sensitive paths, parallel user/agent work is likely, or a cleaner review surface materially helps.
- Detect existing isolation first; if the harness already provided an isolated workspace or linked worktree, reuse it instead of creating nested isolation.
- Prefer native harness isolation over manual git-worktree management when both are available.
- If isolation is unavailable, sandbox-blocked, or the user declines it, continue in place and note that choice when it affects cleanup, review clarity, or confidence.

### Patch discipline

- Before manual `apply_patch` edits to prose, config, or non-symbol glue, read the current target slice and anchor on nearby stable headings, keys, or function signatures.
- Prefer one file and one small hunk per patch when context may drift. Do not quote long paragraphs as required context unless that exact text was just read.
- If `apply_patch` reports missing expected lines, treat it as stale context: re-read the target slice, shrink the patch to verified current text, and retry once before changing strategy. Do not rerun the same failed patch from memory.

### Git safety

- Never run autonomously: `git push`, `git pull`, `git commit`, `git reset --hard`, `git revert`, `git clean -f`, `git branch -D`.
- Never use hook or signature bypass flags unless explicitly requested.

---

## 7. Execution discipline

Define success before non-trivial work. Choose the smallest safe path.

If the user asked only for diagnosis or explanation, stop at confirmed root cause or answer unless they also asked for a fix.

### Scope expansion

When discovery reveals adjacent work, classify it before acting:

- **Required** — necessary to satisfy the approved goal or make verification pass. Include it and mention the expansion in the final report.
- **Blocking decision** — changes behavior, public contracts, migrations, dependencies, or sensitive paths beyond the approved scope. Stop and ask or revise the plan.
- **Follow-up** — useful cleanup, hardening, or unrelated defect. Do not fix opportunistically; report it as a follow-up unless the user expands scope.

Security, data-loss, or production-impacting issues found in touched code may be raised immediately, but still require approval before expanding the edit scope.

### Review checkpoints

- Use `b-review` at coherent checkpoints, not just at the very end, when a slice changes a public or external contract, auth/security/migration boundary, shared route/tool surface, or another milestone broad enough that regressions could hide behind later steps.
- Skip checkpoint review for trivial or purely local steps that do not create a useful review boundary.
- If a checkpoint review is deferred because the tree is still mid-transform or the next step is part of the same tightly coupled verification group, say so explicitly.

### Verification ladder

- Discover baseline commands in this order: explicit plan/user command, project scripts, CI config, repo docs, existing language defaults, then one clarification. Do not invent tooling as verification.
- Narrow local check first (touched file diagnostics, single test).
- Broader affected-area check second (module tests, type/build narrowed to changed area).
- Full project check only when scope or risk justifies it (high-risk per §3, or shared contracts).

### Long-running commands

- Prefer bounded foreground commands with explicit timeouts.
- Starting background jobs, dev servers, containers, emulators, or watch modes requires approval when long-lived or mutating local/shared state.
- If a long-running command is approved, record what was started, how it was stopped, and any remaining process or cleanup action in the final report.

### Iteration cap

Use a **maximum of 3 fix/verify loops per step** before reporting remaining evidence and the blocker. This applies to `b-implement`, `b-debug`, `b-refactor`, and `b-test`. Skills do not restate the number.

### Transform rollback (shared across `b-implement`, `b-refactor`, `b-debug`)

If a partial edit leaves the tree in a broken state (compile failure, import cycle, half-renamed symbol, mid-move imports) and the next iteration cannot move forward without first restoring a coherent baseline:

1. **Finish forward** in one focused pass when the remaining work to coherence is small and the reference map is already in hand, **or**
2. **Patch-based reverse** of only the edits made in the current step/transform.
3. A file-level restore is only acceptable with explicit user approval, because it can discard unrelated user changes in the same path.
4. Never exit the skill with the tree mid-transform — surface the rollback explicitly to the user in the final report.

Skills reference this rule rather than restating it.

### Cascading failures (shared across `b-implement`, `b-refactor`, `b-test`)

If fixing the current step's failure introduces a new failure in a previously-passing area, treat the cascade as evidence that the plan or step scope is wrong, not as another iteration. After **one** attempted cascade fix that does not restore green, stop. Either:

- Trigger the plan revision protocol (§2),
- Hand off to `b-debug` for root cause, or
- Surface the cascade to the user.

Do not burn the iteration cap chasing cascades.

### Completion contract

A non-trivial run is "done" only when **all** are true:

- Required verification ran (or was explicitly skipped with stated reason).
- Status block emitted (§9).
- Artifacts manifest written when more than one artifact exists (§8).
- Outstanding follow-ups land on an existing report surface — the report's `Follow-up` / `Remaining gaps` section, the status block `notes` field, or the `blockers` field when they block the next skill — not silently dropped.
- The tree is in a coherent state — no mid-transform leftovers (see Transform rollback).

### Truncated output

If command output is truncated or times out, save the full output under `/tmp/opencode/b-skills/<skill>/<slug>.log` and inspect the failing section instead of guessing.

### Verification provenance

Every non-trivial final report lists evidence used: commands, diagnostics, browser state, sources, and skipped/unavailable checks. If output timed out/truncated, include the saved log path or say no full log exists.

### Completion closure

- Before reporting non-trivial execution complete, state final verification status, any remaining cleanup or lingering processes/worktrees/test data/artifacts, and the natural next action (review, commit, PR, merge, keep workspace, or discard it).
- If an isolated workspace or linked worktree was used, say whether it remains active and whether cleanup is still pending. Do not delete branches or worktrees without approval.

### Empty-state defaults

When the expected input is missing, do not silently fall back; ask once with a concrete default in mind:
- No git diff → ask which commit, branch, or range to review.
- No approved plan → check if the request meets the small-direct-request threshold (§3); otherwise route to `/b-plan`.
- No test framework in the repo → ask before adding one; never introduce a framework as a side effect.
- No browser-test framework → ask before adding Playwright.
- No MCP for the requested bundle → see the fallback ladder (§4) and label the run as `[degraded: <bundle> unavailable]`.

---

## 8. Artifacts

### Slug algorithm

Derive `<task-slug>` from the user's request:
1. Take the imperative form of the request (drop polite filler, English or Vietnamese).
2. Lowercase. Replace any non-ASCII (including Vietnamese diacritics) with the closest ASCII equivalent.
3. Replace non-alphanumeric runs with `-`. Trim leading/trailing `-`.
4. Cap at **40 characters**. If truncation would split a word, end at the previous `-`.
5. If a collision exists with an unrelated active plan or run, append `-2`, `-3`, … (numeric only; never random suffixes).

Examples:
- "Add rate limiting to the API" → `add-rate-limiting-to-the-api`
- "Đổi tên UserService thành UserRepository" → `doi-ten-userservice-thanh-userrepository`

### Run ID

`<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>-<task-slug>`. All skills use this format.

### Run-id continuity across handoffs

When one skill hands off to another for the same logical task, the receiving skill **reuses** the source skill's `<run-id>` and writes its own artifacts under `.opencode/b-skills/<receiving-skill>/<run-id>/`. Continuity rules:

- A new `<run-id>` is minted only on a fresh user task, not on a handoff.
- The handoff envelope (§9) must carry the `run-id` **whenever one exists** — i.e., whenever the source skill wrote artifacts or itself inherited a `run-id` from an earlier handoff. Pure chat-only handoffs that have produced no artifacts (e.g., a quick-mode `b-plan` handing off to `b-implement` with the plan kept in chat) may omit the `run-id` field; the receiving skill mints one if and when it first writes an artifact.
- If the receiving skill creates artifacts, it cross-links the source run directory in its own `manifest.json` `source_run` field (e.g., `".opencode/b-skills/b-plan/<run-id>/"`).
- When a chain of skills (e.g., `b-plan -> b-implement -> b-review`) all act on the same task and any one of them has written artifacts, every subsequent run directory shares the same `<run-id>` even though each lives under a different `<skill>` subdirectory.

### Non-plan artifact naming

Files inside a run directory follow these conventions so they're predictable across skills:
- `report.md` — the skill's final human-readable report.
- `manifest.json` — the run manifest (schema below).
- `<topic>.log` — captured command output (e.g., `pnpm-test.log`, `playwright-trace.log`).
- `<topic>.snapshot.{txt|json}` — captured tool snapshots (a11y trees, diagnostics dumps).
- `screenshot-<step>.png` — browser screenshots, numbered by interaction order.
- Anything else: lowercase-kebab-case with an explicit content suffix.

### Paths

- **Plans:** `.opencode/b-skills/b-plan/<task-slug>.md` (canonical) after applying the `.opencode/.gitignore` guard in §6. Saved plans remain repo-local source-of-truth files. The legacy `.opencode/b-plans/` is deprecated; do not write there.
- **Skill artifacts:** `.opencode/b-skills/<skill>/<run-id>/` for repo-local non-sensitive artifacts after applying the `.opencode/.gitignore` guard in §6.
- **Saved reports:** `.opencode/b-skills/<skill>/<run-id>/report.md` for explicit review/research reports after applying the `.opencode/.gitignore` guard in §6.
- **Sensitive artifacts:** browser auth/session state and similar secrets default to `~/.config/opencode/b-skills/<skill>/<run-id>/` or `/tmp/opencode/b-skills/<skill>/<run-id>/`; never store them in a tracked worktree path.
- **Temporary logs:** `/tmp/opencode/b-skills/<skill>/<slug>.log`.

Do not write generated artifacts outside those paths unless editing project source files is the task.

### Retention and cleanup

- Keep saved plans and explicit review/research reports until the user removes them; they are source-of-truth or decision artifacts.
- Treat `/tmp/opencode/b-skills/...` artifacts as disposable scratch. Report their paths when they matter, but do not promise persistence.
- Delete or avoid creating sensitive artifacts unless they are required for the task. Browser auth/session state should live in a non-worktree path and be named in the final report.
- When a run creates test data, browser state, screenshots, logs, or generated files, report what was kept, cleaned up, or left for the user to decide.

### Manifest schema

Any run that produces more than one artifact must include `manifest.json` at the root of its run directory:

```json
{
  "run_id": "<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>-<task-slug>",
  "skill": "<b-skill-name>",
  "status": "complete | blocked | partial",
  "source_run": "<relative path to upstream skill's run dir, or null>",
  "artifacts": ["<relative-path>", "..."],
  "commands": ["<command run>", "..."],
  "generated_files": ["<source path edited or created>", "..."],
  "cleanup": "<what was cleaned up, or 'none'>",
  "cost": "<one-line cost summary, see §4, or null>",
  "notes": "<one-line summary>"
}
```

Single-artifact runs may skip the manifest and report these fields inline instead.

---

## 9. Output contract

### Language

- **Chat:** match the language of the user's most recent message. Code identifiers, paths, and command examples stay in their natural form.
- **Saved artifacts:** English (headings, prose, slugs) regardless of chat language, so plans, manifests, and reports remain interoperable.

### Lead with the result

Findings, decisions, or the next action come first. Narration second, if at all. Be concise.

### Skill-exit status block

Every non-trivial skill run ends with a single fenced status block. Use exactly this schema so downstream skills can parse it:

State values:
- `complete` — requested scope is done and required verification ran or was explicitly skipped.
- `blocked` — work cannot continue without an external fix, unavailable dependency, or failed required check.
- `needs-input` — a user decision or approval is required before safe progress.
- `handed-off` — current skill stopped because another skill owns the next required step.

```text
[status]
skill: <b-skill-name>
run-id: <YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>-<task-slug>   (include on any run that wrote artifacts or is part of a handoff chain; omit on pure-chat runs with no artifacts)
state: complete | blocked | needs-input | handed-off
artifacts: <comma-separated paths or 'none'>
next: <skill name or 'none'>
blockers: <one-line list or 'none'>
cause: <cause-class>   (required when state is 'blocked'; omit otherwise)
confidence: high | medium | low — <reason>   (omit when high and evidence is direct)
notes: <cost summary, pre-auth carve-outs, or other run-scoped notes>   (omit the line entirely when empty)
```

Required fields are `skill`, `state`, `artifacts`, `next`, `blockers`. Every other field is **omit-when-empty**: skip the whole line rather than emit a placeholder. The `confidence` line, when present, always sits immediately above `notes` so downstream skills can find it at a fixed offset.

Skill prose that says "close with the skill-exit status block" inherits this schema verbatim; skills must not embed their own copy of the block in output templates.

For trivial runs (a one-line answer, a tiny edit), the block can be omitted.

### Error envelope (failure cause-class)

When `state: blocked`, the `cause` field uses one of these canonical classes so downstream tooling and skills can branch without parsing prose:

| Cause class | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `tool_unavailable` | A required MCP/CLI/server was missing or unreachable. |
| `auth_required` | An auth/permission step blocks progress (user action needed). |
| `user_blocked` | Waiting on a user decision or approval. |
| `iteration_cap` | Hit the §7 cap without resolution; needs new approach or user input. |
| `external_outage` | Third-party service down, registry outage, network failure. |
| `stale_index` | Graph/cache stale and fallback would lose evidence quality. |
| `policy_block` | Action was refused by a safety gate (§6) without approval. |
| `evidence_gap` | Required evidence (test, repro, baseline) is missing and cannot be synthesized. |
| `conflict` | Approved plan conflicts with current repo state or another active artifact. |
| `unsupported` | The request is outside the suite's capability (e.g., no browser available for `b-e2e`). |

A single `cause` per status block. If multiple classes apply, pick the one the user can act on first; mention the others in `blockers`.

### Handoff envelope

When a skill hands off to another skill, emit this fenced block in chat **before** invoking the next skill:

```text
[handoff]
source: <current skill>
run-id: <YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>-<task-slug>   (include when the source skill wrote artifacts; omit on chat-only handoffs)
goal: <one-line goal for the next skill>
decisions: <confirmed decisions or 'none'>
assumptions: <open assumptions or 'none'>
files: <relevant paths or 'none'>
verification: <expected check or 'none'>
blockers: <known blockers or 'none'>
carve-outs: <pre-authorized approvals scoped to this run>   (omit the line entirely when empty)
next-skill: <b-skill-name>
```

Required fields are `source`, `goal`, `decisions`, `assumptions`, `files`, `verification`, `blockers`, `next-skill`. `run-id` and `carve-outs` are **omit-when-empty**. The `run-id` propagates per §8 so the receiving skill writes artifacts under the same run.

### Standard report shape

For non-trivial implementation, debug, test, refactor, review, or research work, final responses include:
- answer, action, or findings first
- verification evidence
- blockers or skipped checks
- confidence signal (§3) when evidence is incomplete
- the natural next action
- the skill-exit status block

### Output verbosity cap

A single skill report must not pad itself to look thorough. Hard caps:

- **BLOCKER findings are never elided.** Every BLOCKER must appear in the report, no matter the count. A BLOCKER by definition prevents shipping; hiding the 16th one risks shipping with unknown blockers.
- **Other-severity findings** (MAJOR / MINOR / NIT): cap at **15 entries per severity**, ranked by impact. Surface the remainder as a one-line `Remaining: N more <severity> findings — request expansion to see them` item.
- **"Checked and clean" entries:** cap at **5**, highest-risk first.
- **Sources / citations:** prefer 2–4 authoritative; never more than 8 unless the user asked for a literature scan.
- **Step-by-step narration:** lead with the result; do not restate every tool call. Tool-by-tool play-by-play belongs in logs, not the report.

When a cap is hit, name it explicitly ("capped at 15 MAJORs") so the user knows the report is bounded, not exhaustive.

## 10. Cross-cutting decisions

### High-risk challenge gate

Before a skill reports completion on work touching auth/authz, security boundaries, migrations, public or external contracts, or irreversible external writes:

1. State the claim in one sentence.
2. Name the strongest remaining risk.
3. Name the evidence that makes the claim acceptable now.

Keep it short. If the evidence is missing or indirect, do not present the work as settled: widen verification, lower confidence, or stop.

### Test failure vs runtime bug

Owned here so `b-test` and `b-debug` agree. Use this table when a test is red:

| Signal | Lane |
|---|---|
| Assertion mismatch and production behavior is confirmed correct | `b-test` — update the test |
| Missing mock, fixture, setup, async/await, leaked state, snapshot drift after intentional change | `b-test` |
| Production behavior is uncertain, ambiguous, or under dispute | `b-debug` — confirm root cause first |
| Test reproduces a real reported symptom | `b-debug` |
| Newly added test exposes pre-existing wrong behavior | `b-debug` |
| Flaky test (passes on rerun without code change) | `b-test` — diagnose flake source; if root cause is a real race or timing bug in product code, switch to `b-debug` |

Never modify production code purely because a test is red. Never modify an assertion, snapshot, or golden file without confirming the intended behavior first.

### Snapshot confirmation procedure

1. State the intended new behavior in one sentence.
2. Point to the source change or product decision that justifies it.
3. Then update the snapshot.

### Flake handling

Rerun the suspected test up to 2 times in isolation. If it passes some runs and fails others without any code change, mark it `flaky`, capture the failing output under `/tmp/opencode/b-skills/b-test/`, and investigate ordering, shared state, async timing, or external time/network dependence before either skipping or rewriting it.

### DOM-unit vs browser-flow boundary

- jsdom, happy-dom, React Testing Library, Vue Test Utils, Svelte testing-library, and any test that renders components without launching a real browser → `b-test`.
- Playwright, Cypress, WebdriverIO, Puppeteer, or anything driving a real Chromium/Firefox/WebKit instance → `b-e2e`.
- A test file that boots Playwright but is invoked through the unit-test runner still counts as `b-e2e` because a real browser is launched.
- **Hybrid component tests** (component-scoped tests that mount a real router, real store, real query client, or other non-trivial provider chain) stay in `b-test` as long as the runner is jsdom/happy-dom/node. Promote to `b-e2e` only when a real browser engine drives the flow, or when the test starts requiring real network, real cookies, or visual assertions.

### Agent-cannot-reproduce protocol (shared across `b-debug`, `b-e2e`, `b-test`)

When the user can reproduce a symptom but the agent cannot in the current environment:

1. Do not patch defensively.
2. Capture every state difference between the user's failing context and the current environment: config, version, data, OS, runtime, env vars, feature flags.
3. Ask the user for **one or more** of:
   - the exact command or interaction sequence,
   - logs or stack trace at the moment of failure,
   - environment details (versions, env vars, feature flags),
   - a minimal repro snippet or test.
4. If the user cannot supply more, offer three options explicitly: (a) instrument and wait, (b) treat as one-shot and close, (c) investigate the captured environment diff.
5. Never silently substitute speculation for a real repro.

### Self-review vs reviewing-someone-else's-code

`/b-review` handles both. The skill must state which mode it is in:
- **Self-review:** assume author bias. Be harsher on "obviously correct" assumptions; verify the spec the author claims to satisfy.
- **External review:** assume the author cannot answer follow-ups. Be explicit about what would block the merge vs what is style.

---

## 11. Session lifecycle

### Session-start preflight (run once at first non-trivial action)

1. `git status --short` — note dirty state; preserve unrelated changes (§6).
2. Note whether the current checkout is already isolated (linked worktree, harness-provided workspace, or equivalent). Reuse existing isolation; do not nest it casually.
3. Check for an approved plan under `.opencode/b-skills/b-plan/` matching the current request.
4. Confirm MCP availability lazily on first use.
5. Acknowledge dirty state only when it could affect the request.

### Crash/resume

- If a prior session left a partially complete run directory under `.opencode/b-skills/<skill>/<run-id>/`, resume from its manifest's last `complete` artifact rather than restarting.
- If no manifest exists, treat the directory as orphaned; do not delete it without asking.
- For saved plans, use the staleness gate (§2) to decide whether to resume or re-plan.

### Cross-skill conventions

- Skill descriptions cover **intent and disambiguation only**. Trigger keywords live in §1, not duplicated in every skill description.
- Skills must not redefine any of the items below. Reference the canonical section instead.
  - **Rubrics (§3):** severity, risk, "non-trivial", "small direct request", confidence signal.
  - **Routing (§1, §10):** test-vs-bug decision, DOM-unit vs browser-flow boundary, hybrid component test boundary, self/external review boundary.
  - **Protocols (§5, §6, §7, §10):** citation provenance, privacy gate, onboarding rule, iteration cap, transform rollback, cascading failures, agent-cannot-reproduce protocol, completion contract, snapshot confirmation, flake handling.
  - **Schemas (§8, §9):** run-id format, slug algorithm, artifact paths, manifest schema, status block, handoff envelope, output verbosity caps.
  - **Anti-patterns (§12):** common rationalizations table — skills reference it; they do not maintain their own copies.
- A skill should switch to another skill only on a real stop/block condition — not for optional enrichment the current skill can finish inline with bounded evidence.

---

## 12. Common rationalizations (suite-wide anti-patterns)

These are the recurring justifications agents use to bypass discipline. When tempted, name the rationalization and apply the counter — do not act on it.

| Rationalization | Counter |
|---|---|
| "I'll fix this adjacent thing while I'm here." | Only if required to satisfy the approved step or make verification pass; otherwise it is a follow-up (§7 scope expansion). |
| "I'll verify after the whole feature lands." | Each step must prove itself before its assumptions carry into the next (§7 verification ladder). |
| "The framework behavior is obvious." | If docs drove the choice, cite a fetched source (§5 citation provenance). |
| "This dirty workspace is probably fine." | For non-trivial work, decide isolation intentionally (§6 isolated workspace preference). |
| "Tests pass, so it's probably fine." | Tests do not replace contract, security, or operability review. |
| "The diff is tiny." | Risk bucket, not line count, decides depth (§3). |
| "This is probably the cause." | Not enough; state `Root cause: <what> because <why>` before editing. |
| "I can leave the probe in until later." | Every temporary probe must be removed before reporting success. |
| "I can't reproduce it, but a defensive patch is harmless." | Cannot-reproduce is a real evidence gap — follow the agent-cannot-reproduce protocol (§10). |
| "I'll phrase the finding softly." | Severity should match actual ship risk, not reviewer comfort. |
| "I'll just bump the iteration count one more time." | After 3 fix/verify loops on the same step, the answer is the report, not another attempt (§7). |
| "I'll cite this from memory." | Citations must come from a fetched source in this session (§5). |
