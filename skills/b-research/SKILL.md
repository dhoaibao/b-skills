$ARGUMENTS

Handle external knowledge at the lightest reliable depth. Start with lookup; auto-deepen only when evidence requires it.

If `$ARGUMENTS` is provided, treat it as the research question and proceed directly.

## When to use

- Library, framework, SDK, or API questions.
- Config keys, method signatures, setup details, capability checks, or migration facts.
- Comparisons, deep dives, cited reports, recency-sensitive topics, or multi-source synthesis.
- Questions about known URLs, local docs, PDFs, spreadsheets, or other source material.

## When NOT to use

- Runtime bug tracing or root-cause analysis → use **b-debug**.
- Deciding what to build or how to sequence work → use **b-plan**.
- Pre-PR review of changed code → use **b-review**.
- **The question is answerable from the codebase.** If a single Serena lookup, repo grep, or local doc read would settle the question, stay in the active skill — do not route to research for what local evidence already answers.

## Tools required

- `context7-docs` (primary for library/framework API lookups) — including the version-pinning rule in `AGENTS.md` §4.
- `brave-discovery` (page discovery).
- `firecrawl-extraction` (default extraction tier).
- `firecrawl-extended` *(optional, for site maps or structured field extraction)*.
- `firecrawl-deep` *(last resort; requires explicit user approval per invocation, or a run-scoped capped pre-authorization per `AGENTS.md` §4)*.

Fallbacks: `AGENTS.md` §4. Graceful degradation: ⚠️ Partial — lookups remain strong with Context7 or authoritative search; synthesis is weaker without extraction.

## Steps

### Step 1 — Pick the starting depth

Choose the lightest depth that can plausibly answer:

- **Lookup** — one fact, one signature, one config key, a yes/no capability, or a tiny example.
- **Research** — anything requiring more than one source, comparison, multi-step synthesis, or recency-sensitive answer.

If the user provided a URL, file, or document, extract it immediately when likely sufficient; otherwise continue into research.

### Step 2 — Pin the version (library/API questions)

Before any `context7-docs` query:

1. Resolve the library version from manifests **and** lockfiles. Use `package-lock.json` / `pnpm-lock.yaml` / `yarn.lock`, `poetry.lock` / `uv.lock`, `go.sum`, `Cargo.lock`, or equivalent.
2. In monorepos, resolve at the workspace closest to the touched file, not the repo root.
3. If the version is ambiguous or conflicting, ask before querying.
4. **Unpinned / floating libraries.** If the manifest specifies a floating range and no lockfile exists (greenfield repo, just-installed deps, scratch project), state the floating range explicitly and query the **latest stable** version. Mark the answer with `Confidence: medium — version unpinned, latest assumed` so the user knows the answer can drift. Never silently pick a version.
5. **Conflicting authoritative versions.** If the docs source serves a different version than the pinned one (e.g., Context7 only has `v3`, repo is on `v2`), do not silently substitute. State the version mismatch in `Limitations` and either ask the user to switch sources or proceed with `Confidence: low` and a labeled `version-mismatch` note.

Skip this step for non-library research.

### Step 3 — Gather evidence

**Lookup:**
1. `context7-docs` first for library/framework APIs.
2. Otherwise one focused `brave-discovery` query to find the highest-signal authoritative source.
3. Answer immediately only when the result is backed by Context7, a direct-source extraction, or another primary source already in hand.
4. **Auto-deepen to research** when the first results are stale, mutually contradict, are not authoritative, or do not directly answer. Do not retry the same shape of query forever.
5. Do not scrape broad result sets for **open-ended** lookup. If a snippet would be final evidence, extract one highest-signal source or label snippet-only with `Confidence: low` (`AGENTS.md` §5). Direct-source lookup may extract the provided source immediately.

**Research:**
1. Prefer official docs, release notes, source repos, and vendor materials first.
2. Use `brave_news_search` only for recency-sensitive topics; use `brave_image_search` only when the question is genuinely visual.
3. Use `firecrawl-extraction` (`firecrawl_scrape` for known URLs, `firecrawl_parse` for local documents) on the highest-signal pages.
4. Reach for `firecrawl-extended` only for site mapping or structured-field extraction.
5. Use `firecrawl-deep` only after lower tiers fail; surface cost and get approval per invocation (`AGENTS.md` §6). If the user has granted a run-scoped capped pre-authorization (`AGENTS.md` §4), use it within the cap, decrement on each call, and report the remaining count in the status block.

Honor the public-web privacy gate (`AGENTS.md` §6) on every external call. Reuse fetched results (`AGENTS.md` §4).

### Step 3b — Handle gated sources

When the most authoritative source is paywalled, login-gated, or otherwise inaccessible (academic journals, vendor support portals, gated changelogs, private status pages):

1. Do not bypass the gate — never fabricate credentials, scrape behind auth, or paste user-supplied secrets into a fetch.
2. Try open mirrors in this order: (a) publisher's free abstract or summary, (b) cached or archived versions (e.g., Wayback Machine) — only when policy-compatible, (c) reputable secondary sources that cite the gated original.
3. If the gated source is the only authoritative answer and no mirror exists, stop and tell the user: name the source, what it would resolve, and ask whether to (i) proceed with the best open evidence and mark single-source/medium confidence, or (ii) pause for them to supply the document via `firecrawl_parse` on a local copy.
4. Never silently substitute a weaker source — label the limitation in the `Limitations` section.

### Step 4 — Resolve source conflicts

When two authoritative sources disagree:

1. Prefer the one matching the pinned version (Step 2).
2. If both match, prefer the publisher's own docs over third-party tutorials.
3. If still ambiguous, present both with the conflict labeled and attach `Confidence: medium`.

### Step 5 — Synthesize

1. Answer only from gathered evidence.
2. For lookup, stay concise and direct.
3. For research, cite the sources that support the answer.
4. Note freshness or access limitations when relevant.
5. Attach the **confidence signal** from `AGENTS.md` §3 whenever evidence is partial, single-source, or recency-sensitive. Omit the line on trivial high-confidence answers.

Close the run with the skill-exit status block (`AGENTS.md` §9) for research-mode work; lookup answers may omit it.

(Confidence line only when not high.)

### Key findings
- [finding]

### Limitations
- [gap, staleness, or unavailable source]

### Sources
- [title](URL)
- Context7 (`library-id`@`version`) for [feature]

**Confidence:** high | medium | low — <one-clause reason>
```

## Rules

- Never ask the user to choose between lookup and research; the skill decides and auto-deepens.
- Use the lightest depth that can answer correctly.
- Public-web privacy gate is owned in `AGENTS.md` §6; honor it on every external call.
- Search snippets are discovery only. Do not use them as final evidence unless the answer is explicitly labeled snippet-only with `Confidence: low`.
- Do not scrape broad result sets in open-ended lookup; direct-source lookup from a user-provided URL, file path, or document may extract that one source immediately.
- Pin the library version (manifests + lockfiles) before any `context7-docs` query.
- Prefer 2–4 authoritative sources over a long weak list.
- Do not force an example block for fact-only quick answers.
- If only one authoritative source supports the answer, label it as single-source.
- Never use `firecrawl-deep` before exhausting default and extended tiers, and never without explicit user approval. The default is **per-invocation approval**. A user may substitute a **run-scoped capped pre-authorization** ("approved up to N uses for this run") under the rules in `AGENTS.md` §4 — record the cap in the status block `notes` / handoff `carve-outs`, decrement on each use, and never exceed the cap. Carve-outs never override §6 safety gates.
- Use a `Limitations` section instead of filling factual gaps from prior model knowledge.
- Reuse results fetched earlier in the same session; do not re-fetch identical pages.
- **Cited URLs must come from fetched results.** Honor the citation-provenance rule in `AGENTS.md` §5: every URL in `Sources` must trace back to an actual `context7-docs`, `brave-discovery`, `firecrawl-extraction`, or user-supplied fetch in this session — never recalled from memory.
