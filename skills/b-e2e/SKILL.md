$ARGUMENTS

Use a real browser to verify user-facing flows, then optionally turn a successful flow into repo-native browser test code. Two modes: **verify** and **author**.

## When to use

- The user wants a live browser flow tested or reproduced.
- The task is UI verification, frontend bug reproduction, or browser-based state inspection.
- The user wants to write or fix an end-to-end browser test (Playwright, Cypress, WebdriverIO, Puppeteer).

## When NOT to use

- The task is a DOM-rendered unit test (jsdom, RTL, Vue Test Utils) → use **b-test**. See the **DOM-unit vs browser-flow boundary** in `AGENTS.md` §10.
- The issue is backend or non-UI runtime debugging → use **b-debug**.
- The task is planning a feature or flow before implementation → use **b-plan**.

## Tools required

- `playwright-browser` (required) — see `AGENTS.md` §4 for the bundle, including the local-CLI fallback.
- `serena-symbol-toolkit` *(optional, for editing existing browser test files)*
- `bash` and native file tools — target health checks, config discovery, manifests, and writing repo test files when needed.

Fallbacks: per `AGENTS.md` §4, prefer Playwright MCP; if unavailable, drive the project's local Playwright CLI via `bash`; if neither is available, stop and tell the user browser automation is unavailable.

Graceful degradation: ⚠️ Partial — MCP path is fastest; CLI fallback works when the project already has Playwright installed.

## Steps

### Step 1 — Prepare the run

1. Create a session-specific artifact directory using the run-id format from `AGENTS.md` §8. Use `.opencode/b-skills/b-e2e/<run-id>/` only when `.opencode/` is already ignored by git in the current repo; otherwise use `~/.config/opencode/b-skills/b-e2e/<run-id>/` for persistent artifacts or `/tmp/opencode/b-skills/b-e2e/<run-id>/` for disposable ones.
2. Determine the **target**: a URL, an extension surface, a local app, or an authenticated entry point. Record the target type.
3. Before touching `localhost`, verify the server is reachable. Do not start a dev server without approval (canonical approval ask in `AGENTS.md` §6).
4. Clarify only what blocks the flow: auth/session state, test data, and whether writes are allowed.
5. **Auth state reuse:** if a safe stored auth state file already exists (for example under `~/.config/opencode/b-skills/b-e2e/.../storage-state.json`), load it instead of re-authenticating. If no auth state exists and the flow needs auth, store the post-login state in a non-worktree path such as `~/.config/opencode/b-skills/b-e2e/<run-id>/storage-state.json` so later steps and re-runs can reuse it. Do not create real auth state under repo-local `.opencode/...` unless that path is already ignored and the user explicitly wants repo-local persistence.

### Step 2 — Pick the mode

- **Verify mode** — drive the browser once, capture evidence, report findings. No test files are written. Continue at Step 3V.
- **Author mode** — write or fix repo-native browser test code. Often starts with a verify pass to confirm the flow works manually. Continue at Step 3A.

If the user wants both ("verify it then write a test"), do verify first, then transition to author with the captured flow as the spec.

### Step 3V — Drive the browser (verify mode)

1. Navigate to the target.
2. Capture an accessibility snapshot before interacting.
3. Execute the requested flow with first-class tools from `playwright-browser`. Wait for specific UI state instead of arbitrary sleeps.
4. If the MCP bundle is unavailable, run the equivalent flow through the project's local Playwright CLI; record the command.
5. Re-snapshot or screenshot the relevant state.
6. Inspect console or network when the UI outcome depends on client errors or API calls.
7. **Viewport check is opt-in.** Test only the requested viewport unless the user explicitly asks for multi-viewport (or the task is responsive-layout work).
8. If a step looks flaky, apply the flake handling rule in `AGENTS.md` §10 before reporting flake.
9. Distinguish **functional snapshot** (assert state or text content) from **visual regression** (pixel diff). Use the former by default; do not introduce visual regression baselines without approval.

### Step 3A — Author or fix browser tests (author mode)

1. Inspect the repo's existing browser-test setup first: `playwright.config.*`, `cypress.config.*`, package scripts, test directories, naming conventions.
2. Preserve the repo's current framework instead of forcing Playwright everywhere.
3. **Empty state** (`AGENTS.md` §7): if no browser-test framework exists and the user wants new test code, ask before introducing one.
4. Translate a successful flow into stable test code using accessible selectors and clear assertions.
5. Persist auth state via `storageState` when the test would otherwise re-authenticate every run.
6. Run the new/updated test once via the project's normal command and confirm it passes.

### Step 4 — Cleanup

1. Close the browser.
2. Clean up only test data created by this run, and only when that cleanup was approved.
3. **Partial-run cleanup:** if the flow failed mid-way, enumerate every write the run completed before the failure (accounts created, records inserted, files uploaded, sessions opened) and clean those up too — do not assume "test failed → nothing to undo." If cleanup of a partial write was not pre-approved, surface the list explicitly so the user can decide.
4. Record artifact paths, generated test files, partial writes, and cleanup status in the run manifest per `AGENTS.md` §8.

Close with the skill-exit status block (`AGENTS.md` §9).

## Output format

```text
### b-e2e: [flow]

**Mode:** [verify / author]
**Target:** [URL / extension / local app / authenticated surface]
**Driver:** [MCP / local CLI]
**Scope:** [flow tested]

#### Interactions
- [step]
- [step]

#### Assertions
- [passed or failed state]

#### Test code
- [none / file updated / file created]

#### Artifacts
- `.opencode/b-skills/b-e2e/<run-id>/` or a non-worktree fallback path
```

## Rules

- Always snapshot before guessing where to click or type.
- Do not start a dev server without approval.
- Do not mutate production-like data without explicit confirmation.
- Preserve the repo's existing browser-test framework when editing test files.
- Do not introduce Playwright test files into a non-Playwright repo unless the user approves.
- Multi-viewport checks are opt-in, not default.
- Do not introduce visual regression baselines without approval; default to functional snapshots.
- `*_unsafe` tool variants require explicit user approval per invocation (`AGENTS.md` §4).
- Always close the browser when the run is complete.
- Persist auth state in a non-worktree path when re-login would be repeated work; never commit auth state files containing real credentials.
