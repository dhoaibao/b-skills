  Think before coding. ALWAYS invoke when the user says "plan", "thiết kế", "how should I approach", "lên kế hoạch", "nên bắt đầu từ đâu", or the task spans more than 2 files or has unclear scope. Decomposes work, evaluates approaches, and writes plans. Unlike b-implement, b-plan decides what to build; it does not execute approved steps.

$ARGUMENTS

Think before coding. Lock scope, evaluate approaches, decompose into ordered steps,
surface risks and unknowns, then produce a clear plan file before any implementation.

If `$ARGUMENTS` is provided, treat it as the task description — skip asking "what do you want to build?" and proceed directly with the stated task. Ask only for missing context (constraints, greenfield vs existing, issue URL).

## When to use

- Task involves more than 2 files or multiple layers (API, DB, service, UI).
- Task has unclear scope or multiple valid approaches — need a decision.
- User is about to implement something non-trivial and hasn't thought through the order.
- Refactoring, architecture changes, or new feature integration.
- User says: "plan", "thiết kế", "how should I approach X", "lên kế hoạch", "nên bắt đầu từ đâu".

## When NOT to use

- Simple single-file edit or ≤2-step task → do it directly.
- Something is broken → use **b-debug**.
- An approved plan is ready to execute → use **b-implement**.
- Quick fact or library lookup → use **b-research**.
- Mechanical refactoring with a clear target already defined → use **b-refactor**.

## Tools required

- `sequentialthinking` — from `sequential-thinking` MCP server *(optional, for approach evaluation and decomposition when available)*.
- `check_onboarding_performed`, `onboarding`, `find_symbol`, `get_symbols_overview`, `find_referencing_symbols`, `find_declaration`, `find_implementations` — from `serena` MCP server *(required for symbol-aware modify-existing-code tasks; optional for greenfield)*.
- `resolve-library-id`, `query-docs` — from `context7` MCP server *(optional, for inline library verification — simple lookups only)*.
- `brave_web_search` — from `brave-search` MCP server *(optional, for tool/approach comparison — simple lookups only)*.
- `firecrawl_scrape` — from `firecrawl` MCP server *(optional, for scraping issue/ticket URL when present)*.
- `gitnexus` — from `gitnexus` MCP server *(optional radar for graph-shaped repo discovery: architecture, cross-file impact, multi-repo mapping — only when indexed and fresh)*.

Fallbacks follow the global MCP rules. If context7 or brave-search cannot answer a required tech lookup, delegate to `/b-research`. If firecrawl is unavailable, keep issue/ticket URLs as plain references.

Graceful degradation: ✅ Possible — core planning works without MCPs using inline reasoning plus bash/read.

## Steps

### Step 0 — Mode select

Choose the lightest mode that fits the task before any other work.

- **Quick mode** — scoped daily tasks: clear end state, low risk, usually ≤2 files, no DB/schema migration, no public API contract change, no security-sensitive behavior. Output a concise 2–5 step chat plan with a verification step. After approval, hand off to **b-implement** unless the user explicitly asks to continue in the same session.
- **Full mode** — unclear, high-risk, multi-layer, or >2-file work. Run all steps below and write a plan file to `.opencode/b-plans/`.

**Selection rule**: choose yourself from task complexity; do not ask the user. Announce the chosen mode in one sentence and why. Ask only when both modes are genuinely valid and preference matters.

**Escalate quick → full** when discovery reveals broad references, unclear requirements, a structural decision, external API uncertainty, or deployment risk.

Broad or unclear refactors stay with `b-plan` until reduced to concrete mechanical transformations that can be handed off to `b-refactor`.

In quick mode: skip Steps 2–6 unless escalation triggers; produce the chat plan, ask for approval, then hand off to **b-implement** or proceed only when the user explicitly asks to continue.

---

### Step 1 — Scope lock

Confirm what is being built before scanning any code.

**If the task is clearly scoped** (user already described the full feature, no ambiguity):
- State the interpreted scope in one sentence and proceed. Use the final plan approval in Step 6 as the confirmation gate.
- Note greenfield vs existing — if existing → continue to Step 2; if greenfield → skip Step 2.

**If the task has unclear scope**:
- Ask the three scope questions:
  - **What is the end state?** What does "done" look like exactly?
  - **What are the hard constraints?** Performance, compatibility, deadlines, must-not-break areas.
  - **What does success look like?** 2–4 concrete, verifiable criteria.
- Ask once. If still unclear, ask one focused follow-up. Don't loop.

**Unknown-handling rule** *(enforced throughout all steps)*: ask immediately for behavioral, product, priority, integration-contract, or naming decisions that the codebase cannot answer. For low-risk engineering details with one conventional answer, proceed only if you record the assumption explicitly and it does not change user-visible behavior. Never hide assumptions.

**Decision accumulation** *(running record across all steps)*: each time a user answer, codebase finding, or approach choice settles a behavioral or design question, record it as a numbered confirmed decision. Compile into `## Confirmed decisions` in the plan. Format each entry as a single, unambiguous, implementation-actionable statement — no hedging, no "consider", no "may". Example: `"Realtime update must update the existing VoiceCall matched by VendorCallKey; if soft-deleted, insert a new row instead."`

**Feasibility check** *(inline when scope is non-trivial)*:
- Does the current architecture support this? Use Serena symbol discovery and reference tracing where supported; native read/bash for prose, config, and exact strings.
- Any blockers? (Missing infrastructure, incompatible dependencies, architectural gaps.)
- Effort estimate: S (hours) / M (1–2 days) / L (3–5 days) / XL (1–2 weeks) / XXL (weeks+).
- If blockers found: state clearly. If no workaround exists, do not proceed until resolved.
- If the task looks XL–XXL and depends on an unfamiliar pattern or unverified library, stop and run /b-research first when the answer affects feasibility, architecture, external contracts, security, or migration order.

---

### Step 2 — Scan existing code *(existing-code tasks only)*

Use GitNexus only for graph-shaped discovery under the global freshness/target gate; skip it for known-file, known-symbol, or local-only planning. Then follow this order:

1. **Graph-level discovery first** *(only when GitNexus applies)* — use repo context/query to understand architecture or cross-module boundaries, then confirm exact symbols with Serena.
2. **Initialize project knowledge** — call `check_onboarding_performed`. If false, call `onboarding` once.
3. **Discover symbols** — `find_symbol` on the main function, class, command, handler, or module involved in the change.
4. **Inspect structure** — `get_symbols_overview` on each relevant file to see which symbols are worth reading.
5. **Resolve owners** — use `find_declaration` when the task description or code path points at a call site, imported helper, or usage rather than the owning definition.
6. **Trace polymorphic boundaries** — use `find_implementations` when the change hangs off an interface, abstract class, or protocol.
7. **Trace references** — `find_referencing_symbols` on key exported/shared symbols to confirm callers and dependents.
8. **Read narrowly** — only if the above leaves ambiguity: native `read` on the exact section needed; native bash search for exact strings.

**Issue/ticket** *(optional context source — only when the user provides or explicitly mentions one)*:
- If a URL is provided: `firecrawl_scrape` with `formats: ["markdown"], onlyMainContent: true`. Trim to 800 words; use as **requirements context** for Steps 3–5. If <200 chars or 403: store the URL as a plain reference.
- If a ticket ID (not URL) is provided: store as-is; no fetch.
- Do not interrupt ordinary planning just to ask for an issue URL.

**Goal**: reference real paths and symbols. A plan that names wrong files or non-existent functions fails at execution. Never paste full file contents into the plan — only names and line references that matter.

---

### Step 3 — Evaluate approaches *(conditional)*

Run if the task has a structural decision: new module vs extending existing, sync vs async, REST vs event-driven, library A vs B.

1. List 2–3 viable approaches with key trade-offs (complexity, performance, coupling, reversibility).
2. Use `sequentialthinking` to evaluate them against the current constraints.
3. Make the reasoning useful for execution: chosen approach, alternatives rejected, the assumption that could flip the decision, the first implementation step.
4. Pick one and document in `## Decision`.
5. Add the approach choice and structural trade-offs to the running confirmed decisions list.

Skip this step if the approach is already obvious — do not invent choices where none exist.

---

### Step 4 — Decompose

Use `sequentialthinking` to break the chosen approach into atomic, ordered steps:

- Each step: independently executable, independently verifiable.
- Ordered by dependency — not by what's easiest.
- Usually 4–8 steps. Split into phases if >10.
- Each step answers: *what*, *why now*, *done when* — and must include:
  - **Exact file paths** and **symbol names** (e.g. `src/auth/middleware.ts:validateToken()`).
  - **Current state** of anything being changed.
  - **Concrete done-when** verifiable independently (test command, observable output, specific assertion).
  - Any **API signatures**, **config keys**, or **contract details** needed to implement without further lookup.
  - **`Exact [X]:`** sub-bullets for any implementation choices that must be locked in to prevent implementor drift — e.g. `Exact insertion points:`, `Exact helper responsibilities:`, `Exact fields to create:`. Add whenever the step would otherwise leave a structural decision open.
- **Full-mode handoff standard: 90%+** — if a fresh agent with zero prior context would need to ask a follow-up question to implement the step, the step is not detailed enough. Add the missing detail now. Do not apply this level of detail to quick-mode chat plans.
- Ask sequentialthinking for output in this shape: `Goal`, `Constraints`, `Ordered steps`, `Dependencies`, `Open questions`, `First action`.

**Impact checkpoint** *(modify-existing-code only)*:
- `find_referencing_symbols` on the main symbol/module being changed.
- If GitNexus applies under the global gate, use `gitnexus impact` or `gitnexus context` to estimate broad blast radius before narrowing with Serena references.
- If the plan explicitly includes renaming an exported/public symbol, call out broad references as migration risk and leave the actual rename to `b-implement` or `b-refactor`.
- Wide downstream impact → split into smaller phases or add rollback steps.

**Deploy safety** — annotate any step that matches:
- New routes/endpoints → `⚠️ consider feature flag`
- DB schema changes → `⚠️ deploy order: [before / after] app deploy`
- New external service calls → `⚠️ verify availability in target environment`

**Planned touch points** — after decomposing, compile `## Planned touch points`: one bullet per file/class that will change, with the exact path and what is added/changed/removed at method or field level.

**Mapping/contract table** *(conditional — only when the task involves field mapping, data transformation, or protocol contracts)*: produce `## Mapping outline` listing every source → target mapping with repo field names, types, and normalization notes.

---

### Step 5 — Identify unknowns

Flag anything unresolved before handing off:

| Type | Action |
|---|---|
| **User decision** — behavioral choice, priority, integration contract, naming, or anything the codebase can't answer | ⛔ Stop. Ask the user immediately. Do NOT write the plan until resolved. |
| **Tech lookup** — library API behavior, yes/no capability, 2-option comparison | Resolve inline: `query-docs` (context7) or `brave_web_search`. Append `→ Confirmed: [finding]`. |
| **Complex research that affects feasibility/architecture/contracts/security/migration order** | ⛔ Stop. Use /b-research first, then resume planning with the confirmed result. |
| **Complex research that is informational only** | Mark as `Follow-up — optional /b-research: [topic]`. Do not block the plan. |

**Clarification gate** — before Step 6, batch all outstanding blocking user decisions and blocking research needs into one message and wait for answers/results. Only write the plan after every blocking unknown is resolved.

---

### Step 6 — write plan

**Quick mode**: keep the plan in chat unless the user asks for a saved plan. Present the step list, ask for approval. After approval, hand off to **b-implement** unless the user explicitly asks to continue in the same session.

**Full mode**: write to `.opencode/b-plans/[task-slug].md` in the **current project root only**.

- `task-slug` = kebab-case, e.g. `add-retry-logic`, `refactor-auth-module`.
- Create `.opencode/b-plans/` if it doesn't exist.
- Show the exact saved path after writing.

Present a short summary (scope + step count) and ask for confirmation. Update and re-confirm if the user requests changes. After approval, hand off to **b-implement** unless the user explicitly asks to continue in the same session.

```

---

## Rules

- Full mode must write to `.opencode/b-plans/` — never leave full-mode plans only in chat.
- Quick mode may stay in chat unless the user asks for a saved plan.
- Always write saved plan files in English.
- Do not implement until the user approves the plan. After approval, use **b-implement** unless the user explicitly asks to continue in the same session.
- Do not over-plan scoped quick tasks — keep them to the smallest useful step list and verification gate.
- Steps must be ordered by dependency — wrong order causes cascading failures.
- Keep steps atomic — one clear action per step.
- Surface risks and assumptions proactively.
- Split into phases if 10+ steps.
- **Never self-infer ambiguous requirements** — ask the user immediately. Low-risk implementation assumptions are allowed only when recorded and non-behavioral.
- **Handoff standard: 90%+** — every step must be detailed enough that a fresh agent with zero prior context can implement it without asking a follow-up question.
