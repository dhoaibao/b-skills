$ARGUMENTS

Think before coding. Lock scope, pick the smallest viable approach, and produce an execution-ready plan.

If `$ARGUMENTS` is present, treat it as the task description and proceed. Ask only for missing context that blocks safe planning.

## When to use

- The task is **non-trivial** per `AGENTS.md` §3.
- The goal is clear, but sequencing, dependency order, or approach is not.
- There are multiple valid approaches and the choice matters.
- The user wants a plan, architecture direction, or ordered implementation steps.
- A refactor is still vague and not yet a concrete rename, extract, move, inline, or delete.

## When NOT to use

- The request meets the **small direct request** threshold in `AGENTS.md` §3 → use **b-implement**.
- The end state or acceptance criteria are still ambiguous → use **b-spec**.
- The user already approved a plan → use **b-implement**.
- The request is a concrete behavior-preserving mechanical transformation → use **b-refactor**.
- The blocker is external docs or library behavior → use **b-research**.
- Something is broken → use **b-debug**.

## Tools required

- `serena-symbol-toolkit` *(preferred for planning against existing code)*
- `gitnexus-radar` *(optional, for graph-shaped planning)*
- `context7-docs` *(optional, for a narrow library/API check discovered during planning)*
- `firecrawl-extraction` *(optional, for an issue or ticket URL the user already provided)*

Fallbacks: `AGENTS.md` §4. If broader external research is required, stop and use **b-research**. Graceful degradation: ✅ Possible — native reads plus reasoning still work.

## Steps

### Step 1 — Pick the planning mode

Use the **non-trivial** definition (`AGENTS.md` §3) as the threshold:

- **Quick mode:** trivial, single area, no public contract/sensitive path, low risk. Return a concise chat plan with verification.
- **Full mode:** non-trivial work or real structural choice. Apply the `.opencode/.gitignore` guard (`AGENTS.md` §6), then write `.opencode/b-skills/b-plan/<task-slug>.md` using `AGENTS.md` §8. Saved plans remain canonical source-of-truth files.

Choose the mode yourself. Only ask when both modes are genuinely valid and the user's preference changes the output.

Escalate quick → full if discovery reveals broad references, public contract risk, security-sensitive behavior, or deployment risk.

### Step 2 — Lock scope and decisions

State the interpreted scope in one sentence.

If the target outcome or acceptance criteria are still ambiguous after that restatement, stop and use **b-spec** before sequencing the work.

If the goal is clear but planning inputs are incomplete, ask the smallest set of questions that blocks safe planning:
- hard constraints
- sequencing or deployment constraints
- required verification expectations

Record confirmed decisions as short implementation-ready statements. If a decision is behavioral, contractual, or naming-related and the codebase cannot answer it, ask the user.

If the upstream handoff envelope (`AGENTS.md` §9) carried `assumptions` from `b-spec`, copy them into the plan's `Confirmed decisions` only after explicit user confirmation; otherwise keep them in a plan-level `Assumptions` section so they remain visible without being treated as approved decisions.

If the task depends on unresolved external research that affects feasibility, architecture, contracts, security, or migration order, stop and use **b-research** before finishing the plan.

### Step 3 — Scan existing code when relevant

Skip this step for greenfield work.

- Use `gitnexus-radar` only when the area is graph-shaped or unfamiliar. Stop once the subsystem, route, consumer set, or boundary is clear.
- Use `serena-symbol-toolkit` to pin owners, declarations, references, or behavior. Pick the cheapest discovery tool for the next question per `AGENTS.md` §4.

If the user already provided an issue URL, you may extract it via `firecrawl-extraction` as planning context.

### Step 4 — Choose the approach only if it matters

If there is a real structural choice, list 2–3 viable approaches, compare them against the current constraints, pick one, and record why.

When a real alternative is rejected, record it briefly under `## Confirmed decisions` or `## Alternatives considered`: option plus why it lost.

If the approach is obvious, skip this step. Do not invent fake alternatives.

### Step 5 — Decompose into execution steps

Produce dependency-ordered steps as short as the work actually is. Each step says: changes, exact paths/symbols when known, ordering reason, and `Done when` verification.

For prose-heavy or config-heavy edits, name stable anchors such as headings, keys, or symbols instead of quoting long paragraphs that may drift before implementation.

For saved plans, format execution steps as Markdown task-list items so progress can be updated in place during implementation.

**Quick-mode** chat plans follow the quick-plan template in `skills/b-plan/reference.md`. **Full-mode** saved plans follow the saved-plan skeleton in the same reference, including durable frontmatter from `AGENTS.md` §2. Do not invent ad-hoc plan shapes; both templates exist so progress and approval are mechanically inspectable.

Full-mode steps are written as Markdown task-list items so `b-implement` can update progress in place:

```markdown
## Steps
- [ ] **<imperative step title>**
  - Changes: <files or symbols>
  - Why now: <ordering reason>
  - Done when: <verification>
```

If the task depends on another plan, record it in `Dependencies` per the multi-plan rule in `skills/b-plan/reference.md`.

**Plan-size guardrail.** A saved plan should be coherent enough to verify in one execution pass. Scale the smell threshold to the risk rubric (`AGENTS.md` §3):

| Risk | Soft cap on steps | Soft cap on touch points |
|---|---|---|
| trivial / low | ~8 | ~6 |
| medium | ~12 | ~10 |
| high | no fixed cap | every step must be independently verifiable; split only when slicing is safe |

When the plan exceeds its band's cap without a structural reason, either:

1. Collapse adjacent steps that share verification, or
2. Split into dependent slices (each with its own slug) and record the chain in `Dependencies`.

High-risk migrations may legitimately exceed the medium cap when splitting would create unsafe intermediate states (e.g., a schema migration that must run as one transaction). In that case, mark the plan as a single tightly coupled group per `AGENTS.md` §7 step atomicity and explain why in the plan's `Confirmed decisions`.

Do not save a plan that no agent — fresh or otherwise — can finish in one focused run.

### Step 6 — Deliver the plan

**Quick mode:**
- Keep the plan in chat.
- Ask for approval.
- Hand approved execution to **b-implement** via the handoff envelope in `AGENTS.md` §9.

**Full mode:**
- Apply the `.opencode/.gitignore` guard from `AGENTS.md` §6, then write an English plan to `.opencode/b-skills/b-plan/<task-slug>.md`.
- Show the saved path.
- Ask for approval.
- If approval arrives in the same planning run, update the plan frontmatter in place: `status: approved`, `approved_at: <timestamp>`, `approved_by: user`, and `approved_head: <git-sha>` when the repo has a git HEAD.

The plan is complete only when a fresh agent could execute it without re-deriving the design.

### Step 7 — Revise or supersede (if the user asks to change an approved plan)

- **Revise** when the goal and most touch points survive. Follow the **plan revision protocol** in `AGENTS.md` §2: edit the plan file in place, append a one-line `## Revisions` entry, re-request approval only when the revision touches `Confirmed decisions`, `Planned touch points`, or `Steps`.
- **Supersede** when the goal itself changed or the approach is being replaced wholesale. Follow the supersede protocol in `skills/b-plan/reference.md`: set the old plan's `status: superseded`, create a new plan with a distinct slug, and reference the superseded plan in the new plan's `Dependencies` or `Goal`. Do not delete superseded plans.

Close the run with the skill-exit status block (`AGENTS.md` §9).

## Rules

- Do not implement while planning.
- Keep quick plans lean; do not turn every small task into a full document.
- Save only full-mode plans to `.opencode/b-skills/b-plan/` after applying the `.opencode/.gitignore` guard from `AGENTS.md` §6. The legacy `.opencode/b-plans/` path is deprecated; do not write there.
- Include the durable plan frontmatter from `AGENTS.md` §2 in new saved plans; legacy plans without frontmatter remain valid when explicitly approved in chat.
- Use the slug algorithm in `AGENTS.md` §8; do not invent ad-hoc filenames.
- Surface blocking unknowns instead of hiding them in vague prose.
- Broad or unclear refactors stay in **b-plan** until they reduce to concrete mechanical steps for **b-refactor**.
- After approval, treat the approved plan as the execution source of truth (`AGENTS.md` §2). If the touched files change before execution begins, re-plan rather than improvise.
- Revisions go in place under `## Revisions`; never write `plan-v2.md`.
