  Code refactoring: impact analysis, mechanical transformation, and
  verification. ALWAYS invoke when the user asks for a named
  behavior-preserving transform — rename, extract, move, inline, delete dead
  code, or simplify a specific target. Vague cleanups go to b-plan first.
  Unlike b-plan, which decides what to build, b-refactor owns mechanical

$ARGUMENTS

Handle behavior-preserving mechanical changes: lock target, map impact, transform safely, and verify references.

If `$ARGUMENTS` is provided, treat it as the refactoring instruction and proceed directly.

## When to use

- User asks to rename, extract, move, inline, delete dead code, or simplify a named target in a clearly behavior-preserving way.
- The transformation is meant to preserve behavior.
- The scope is concrete enough to execute without re-deciding product behavior.

## When NOT to use

- The request is broad, vague, partly a feature change, or says only "simplify" without naming the exact behavior-preserving transform → use **b-plan** first.
- The work is mainly implementing new behavior → use **b-implement**.
- The task is a runtime bug fix → use **b-debug**.
- The task is a test-only failure or test rewrite → use **b-test**.
- The request is only an external API lookup → use **b-research**.

## Tools required

- `bash` — inspect git state and run project-specific checks.
- `serena-symbol-toolkit` *(preferred for exact target locking, reference mapping, and symbol-aware edits)*
- `gitnexus-radar` *(optional, for broad exported/shared impact)*

Fallbacks: `AGENTS.md` §4. Serena LSP caveat applies; non-LSP rename/safe-delete/diagnostics are **not authoritative**. Graceful degradation: ⚠️ Partial — local refactors work with native search + `apply_patch`; cross-file work is riskier.

## Steps

### Step 1 — Lock the target

1. Resolve the exact symbol or file to change.
2. Initialize Serena per `AGENTS.md` §4 (once per session, only when symbol-aware work first becomes necessary).
3. If the request starts from a usage site, helper import, interface, or repeated code shape, use the cheapest Serena discovery tool that closes the next question.
4. If the request is still vague after a short inspection, ask the smallest question needed to make the target concrete.

### Step 2 — Assess impact and choose verification depth

1. Run `find_referencing_symbols` on the locked target to enumerate static symbol impact. Treat this as the primary graph-backed mapping step, not a complete proof for dynamic, config-driven, generated, or prose references.
2. Classify the refactor on the **risk rubric** in `AGENTS.md` §3 (trivial / low / medium / high).
3. **Trivial-local fast path** is allowed only when **all** of:
   - One file.
   - No exported/public contract change.
   - Few or no external references.
   - Behavior clearly preserved.
   - Language is **LSP-supported by Serena**.
   - **No generated-code consumers** of the symbol (see below).

   Non-LSP languages (Bash, YAML, Markdown, Lua, many DSLs) auto-promote to **low** risk because rename/safe-delete results are not authoritative.

   **Generated-code carve-out.** If the symbol is consumed by generated code (GraphQL clients, Prisma/ORM types, OpenAPI clients, protobuf stubs, `*.generated.*` files, codegen output committed under `node_modules`/`vendor`), the refactor auto-promotes to at least **medium** risk regardless of the local file count. The reference map (Step 2) must include generated consumers, and verification must regenerate them or confirm the generator source already reflects the new name.
4. For medium or high-risk refactors, optionally use `gitnexus-radar` to scope blast radius before editing. Discover the baseline verification command from project scripts or CI config. If baseline checks are already failing, stop and ask.
5. For non-LSP languages, generated glue, dynamic dispatch, config-driven references, or text/prose references outside Serena's graph, add targeted text searches to the verification worklist before editing.

### Step 3 — Apply the mechanical transform

Choose the smallest matching transformation:

- **Rename symbol** → `rename_symbol`.
- **Delete dead code** → `safe_delete_symbol` after confirming zero references.
- **Extract function** → insert the helper, then update callers.
- **Inline local logic** → update callers, then remove the old symbol safely.
- **Rename + extract:** extract first under the **old** name, verify references, then `rename_symbol` to the new name so each transform is independently verifiable.
- **Move code between files** (highest mechanical risk):
  1. Add the new destination first with `insert_after_symbol` or `apply_patch`; do not delete the origin yet.
  2. Update every import or re-export, using the reference map from Step 2.
  3. Update test-only imports, fixtures, and mocks — these often live outside the LSP graph; grep the suite explicitly.
  4. Update build config, path aliases, barrel files, and route registries when present.
  5. Remove the origin symbol via `safe_delete_symbol` only after diagnostics on every touched file are clean.
  6. Re-run `find_referencing_symbols` on the moved symbol; if any references still point at the old location, stop and investigate.

Use `apply_patch` only for import updates, config, prose, or non-symbol glue, following the patch discipline in `AGENTS.md` §6.

If the work turns into a behavioral redesign instead of a mechanical transform, stop and hand it back to **b-plan** via the handoff envelope in `AGENTS.md` §9. Include the locked target, the reference map produced in Step 2, and the specific decision that turned mechanical.

**Split-across-runs.** If the reference map shows the refactor is too large to verify in one coherent pass (e.g., a move touching 40+ files across unrelated modules), do not attempt it as one run. Stop and hand back to **b-plan** with the reference map and a proposed split:

```text
[handoff to b-plan]
proposed split:
- Run 1: <slice with stable verification boundary>
- Run 2: <next slice, dependent on Run 1 merging>
- Run N: ...
```

Each slice must end with the tree in a coherent, verifiable state. Slices that depend on a prior slice merging go in the new plan's `Dependencies` per `skills/b-plan/reference.md`.

### Step 4 — Verify

1. Run `get_diagnostics_for_file` on touched files when supported (LSP caveat per `AGENTS.md` §4).
2. Run the narrowest typecheck, build, or test command that matches the risk band (verification ladder in `AGENTS.md` §7).
3. Re-check references when the target is shared or exported.
4. Inspect `git diff` to confirm the change stayed within intended scope.
5. If `apply_patch` reports missing expected lines, treat it as stale context; re-read the current target slice and retry only with verified smaller context (`AGENTS.md` §6).
6. If failures indicate a real regression, use **b-debug**. If they indicate test-mechanic drift, use **b-test**.
7. **Partial-completion recovery** is handled by the transform rollback rule in `AGENTS.md` §7. The Step 2 reference map is the worklist when finishing forward.
8. Apply the iteration cap from `AGENTS.md` §7.

Close with the skill-exit status block (`AGENTS.md` §9).

## Output format

```text
### b-refactor: [transformation]

**Target:** [symbol or file]
**Risk:** [trivial / low / medium / high]   (per AGENTS.md §3)
**Impact:** [key references or boundaries]

#### Changes
- `[path:line]` — [what changed]

#### Verification
```bash
[command]
```
[result]

#### Follow-up
- [none / remaining step / user decision needed]
```

## Rules

- Keep the task behavior-preserving; do not quietly add features while refactoring.
- Use the trivial-local fast path only when the contract is untouched and the language is LSP-supported.
- For non-LSP languages, treat every rename or safe-delete as at least **low** risk and verify with broader text-grep plus the project's existing test suite.
- Treat vague "simplify" requests as planning work until the exact behavior-preserving transform is locked.
- Use symbol-aware rename/delete tools whenever they fit the transformation.
- For rename + extract, do extract first, then rename — keep transforms independently verifiable.
- Ask before broad directory moves or other cascading changes through tooling, docs, and imports.
- Do not push past failing medium/high-risk verification without surfacing the blocker.
- Do not commit unless the user explicitly asks.
