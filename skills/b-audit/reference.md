# b-audit Reference

Use this reference to make audits repeatable without turning `SKILL.md` into a long checklist. Pick the smallest matching surface and sample highest-risk paths first.

## Sampling Strategy

- Name the audited surface and baseline before inspecting details.
- Sample entry points, generated consumers, install/runtime outputs, and docs that define user-facing behavior.
- Prefer source files over generated files unless the generated output is the public contract.
- For no-findings audits, list checked-and-clean samples plus skipped areas and residual risk.

## Surface Checklists

### Installer Or Update Path

- Check install, update, dry-run, uninstall, idempotency, backup/restore, and partial-failure behavior.
- Verify managed-file markers, pruning rules, and user-owned file preservation.
- Confirm paths match README and runtime contract paths.

### Runtime Contract Or Governance

- Check routing precedence, source-of-truth order, safety gates, approval lifetime, artifact paths, status blocks, and handoff envelopes.
- Look for duplicated global rules inside skill files.
- Confirm examples and schemas use the current contract version placeholder or concrete version as appropriate.

### Validator Or Tool Boundary

- Check that validator rules enforce documented invariants without forcing duplicated runtime policy.
- Confirm failures are actionable and tied to maintained files.
- Verify managed command wrappers, skill frontmatter, docs coverage, and reference sync are checked.

### Route, Tool, Or Public Contract Boundary

- Identify consumers before judging a route/tool/schema/CLI change safe.
- Check request/response shapes, auth or permission gates, error behavior, and documented fields or flags.
- Treat examples, docs, generated clients, and tests as consumers when they shape user expectations.

### Dependency Or Lockfile Surface

- Check why the dependency changed, whether lockfile updates were approved, and whether install/runtime compatibility is documented.
- Verify security, license, engine, and package-manager implications when they are material.

### Generated Artifact

- Find the generator source or command before trusting the generated output.
- If generated output was edited manually, label evidence as partial and name regeneration follow-up.
- Check snapshots, goldens, docs, and installed outputs against their source inputs.

### Security-Sensitive Rule

- Check auth/authz, secrets, private data, destructive commands, external writes, and public-web privacy gates.
- Require direct evidence for any safe/ready claim; otherwise lower confidence or block.

### b-skills Suite Audit

- Check every `skills/*/SKILL.md` for trigger boundary, stop conditions, task-specific workflow, and global-rule duplication.
- Check `CLAUDE.md`, agents, hooks, settings, and `references/runtime-contract.md` for conflicting schemas, paths, tool priorities, and safety gates.
- Cross-check `README.md` and `REFERENCE.md` only for consistency with runtime-facing files.
- Run `scripts/validate-skills.sh` unless explicitly skipped.
