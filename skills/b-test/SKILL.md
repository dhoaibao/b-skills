description: >
  Test-driven development, test debugging, and test coverage evaluation.
  ALWAYS invoke when the user asks to write tests, fix failing tests,
  evaluate coverage, or work TDD-style. Unlike b-debug, which traces runtime
  bugs, b-test owns test-specific failures: wrong assertions, missing mocks,
  fixture or setup issues, and coverage gaps. Use the test-vs-bug decision in
  AGENTS.md §10 when a red test could go either way.

# b-test

$ARGUMENTS

Own code-level tests: write coverage, fix test-only failures, and avoid treating every red test as product failure.

If `$ARGUMENTS` is provided, treat it as the test task or failing symptom and proceed directly.

## When to use

- User asks to write tests for new or existing behavior.
- A test is failing and the **test-vs-bug decision** in `AGENTS.md` §10 routes the work to the test lane.
- User asks about coverage gaps or missing regression tests.
- DOM-rendered unit tests and hybrid component tests stay here, not in **b-e2e**. See the **DOM-unit vs browser-flow boundary** in `AGENTS.md` §10 for both rules.

## When NOT to use

- The failing test likely exposes a real runtime or product bug (`AGENTS.md` §10) → use **b-debug**.
- The task drives a real browser (Playwright, Cypress, WebdriverIO, Puppeteer) → use **b-e2e**.
- Scope or acceptance is still unclear → use **b-plan**.
- The request is a pre-PR logic review → use **b-review**.
- The task is only an external docs or testing-framework lookup → use **b-research**.
- The task is designing a new property-based, fuzzing, or contract-testing strategy/framework → use **b-plan** first. Adding a small test in an already-established project pattern may stay in **b-test**.

## Tools required

- `bash` — run project test and coverage commands, inspect failure output.
- Native file tools — discover test files, manifests, and focused source/test sections.
- `serena-symbol-toolkit` *(preferred for mapping tests to source behavior and editing existing test code)*
- `context7-docs` *(optional, for verifying testing-framework APIs or matcher behavior)*

Fallbacks: `AGENTS.md` §4. Without Serena, use native discovery plus careful `apply_patch`; LSP caveat applies. Graceful degradation: ✅ Possible with native tools, `bash`, and `apply_patch`.

## Steps

### Step 1 — Discover framework and scope

1. Locate the relevant test files and project-specific test commands from manifests or CI config.
2. If the user named a failing test, start from the narrowest runnable target for that test.
3. Initialize Serena per `AGENTS.md` §4 only when symbol-aware inspection adds value.
4. Map the test ↔ source relationship with the cheapest discovery tool that closes the next question.

**Empty-state** (`AGENTS.md` §7): if the repo has no test framework, do not introduce one as a side effect. Ask the user before adding a framework, even when the request implies tests are wanted.

### Step 2 — Choose the lane

Use `AGENTS.md` §10 (test failure vs runtime bug) to pick the lane:

- **Failing test** — fix test/fixture/setup when production behavior is confirmed correct. If it proves a product bug, hand off to **b-debug** or **b-implement** with evidence.
- **Write tests** — add new regression, unit, or integration coverage for known behavior.
- **Coverage review** — identify the highest-value missing tests and optionally add the top ones.
- **Flaky test** — apply the flake handling procedure in `AGENTS.md` §10 before rewriting or skipping.

If the failure might reflect a real product bug and the correct behavior is not already confirmed, switch to **b-debug**.

### Step 3 — Fix or add tests

**Failing test:**
1. Run the narrowest test command.
2. If output is large, capture it under `/tmp/opencode/b-skills/b-test/` (`AGENTS.md` §7) and inspect the failure section.
3. Read the failing test and the source behavior it exercises.
4. Classify per the test-vs-bug table in `AGENTS.md` §10.
5. For snapshot or golden updates, follow the **snapshot confirmation procedure** in `AGENTS.md` §10.

**New tests:**
1. Identify the behavior, branches, and edge cases that matter.
2. Choose unit or integration scope; hand real-browser flows to **b-e2e**.
3. Cover happy path, edge cases, error handling, and the regression that would catch an accidental revert.
4. Prefer local fixtures unless the repo already has a shared fixture that fits the scenario.

**Coverage review** — rank gaps by value:

| Priority | Gap shape |
|---|---|
| **1 — required** | Changed behavior in the current diff without any covering test. |
| **2 — strong** | Public-contract symbols (exports, routes, handlers, CLI flags) without a regression test. |
| **3 — useful** | Widely referenced internal symbols (high fan-in) without a regression test. |
| **4 — opportunistic** | Edge cases of branches already partially covered. |

Discover the existing coverage command before inventing one; ask before adding a runner. Add top gaps only when the user wants implementation.

**Stop heuristic.** Coverage review is *bounded*, not exhaustive. Stop when **any** is true:
- All priority-1 gaps are closed (changed behavior is covered).
- The next gap is priority-3 or lower and the user has not asked for opportunistic work.
- 5 gaps have been added in one run and no priority-1 remains — surface the rest as a follow-up list.
Never loop through priority-4 gaps autonomously.

**Advanced tests** — property-based, fuzz, and contract tests stay here only when the repo already has an established runner and pattern. If the framework, boundary contract, generator strategy, or CI cost needs design, hand off to **b-plan** instead of inventing it inside a test edit.

Prefer `serena-symbol-toolkit` insertions for existing test bodies. Use `apply_patch` when creating a new test file or when a small non-symbol edit is clearer, following the patch discipline in `AGENTS.md` §6.

### Step 4 — Verify

1. Run `get_diagnostics_for_file` on touched files — both the test and the underlying source — when the language supports it.
2. Re-run the narrowest relevant tests.
3. Widen to a broader suite only when the change touches shared fixtures/helpers, public contracts, or the repo's normal test workflow requires it (verification ladder in `AGENTS.md` §7).
4. If `apply_patch` reports missing expected lines, treat it as stale context; re-read the current target slice and retry only with verified smaller context (`AGENTS.md` §6).
5. Apply the iteration cap from `AGENTS.md` §7.

Close with the skill-exit status block (`AGENTS.md` §9).

## Output format

```text
### b-test: [test task]

**Type:** [failing test / write tests / coverage review / flaky test]
**Framework:** [jest / vitest / pytest / go test / cargo test / other]
**Scope:** [unit / integration / DOM-unit / mixed]

#### Findings
- `[path]` — [what was wrong or what behavior needed coverage]

#### Changes
- `[path:line]` — [test fix or test added]

#### Verification
```bash
[command]
```
[result]

#### Remaining gaps
- [none / uncovered case / follow-up suggestion]
```

## Rules

- Never change production code just because a test is red. Defer to `AGENTS.md` §10 and route confirmed product fixes out of **b-test**.
- Never update an assertion, snapshot, or golden file without confirming intended behavior first; follow the snapshot procedure in `AGENTS.md` §10.
- Real-browser flows belong to **b-e2e**; keep DOM-rendered unit tests here.
- Do not introduce property-based, fuzz, or contract-testing frameworks without a plan and explicit approval.
- Prefer behavior assertions over implementation-detail assertions.
- Keep fixture, mock, and setup changes as local as practical.
- State when broader suite coverage was skipped and why the narrower check was sufficient.
- Never introduce a test framework or coverage runner without explicit approval.
- **Test utilities** (factories, builders, custom matchers, shared fixtures) belong here when they are added, edited, or extended to support a test in scope. Mechanical relocation/rename of an existing test utility is **b-refactor**, not **b-test**.

## Reference pointers

- `references/testing-patterns.md` (installed under `~/.config/opencode/references/b-skills/`) — fallback guidance for naming, fixtures, mocks, and regression-test shape when the repo's own conventions are weak or conflicting.
