description: >
  Test-driven development, test debugging, and test coverage evaluation. ALWAYS invoke when the user asks about writing tests, fixing failing tests, test coverage gaps, or TDD: "test", "viết test", "failing test", "test đang fail", "bắt đầu bằng test", "test coverage", "missing test". Unlike b-debug (traces runtime bugs), b-test focuses on test-specific failures: wrong assertions, missing mocks, setup issues, coverage gaps.

# b-test

$ARGUMENTS

Dedicated skill for test-driven development, test debugging, and coverage evaluation.
Failing CI test and runtime bug have different patterns — this skill owns the test path.

If `$ARGUMENTS` is provided, treat it as the test task or failing test symptom.
Proceed directly. Do not ask "what test do you want to write?" unless `$ARGUMENTS` is empty.

## When to use

- User asks to write tests for new or existing code.
- A test is failing and the issue is assertion, mock, or setup — not runtime logic.
- Evaluating whether test coverage is adequate for a behavior change.
- User says: "test", "viết test", "test case", "failing test", "test coverage",
  "TDD", "unit test", "integration test", "test đang fail", "bắt đầu bằng test",
  "missing test".

## When NOT to use

- Runtime bug in production code → use **b-debug**
- Need a plan for a feature → use **b-plan**
- Review code before PR → use **b-review**
- Quick library API lookup → use **b-research**
- Browser/UI testing or user-flow verification → use **b-e2e**

## Tools required

- `bash` — run test commands, inspect test output, locate test files.
- Native file tools — Glob/Grep/Read for discovery and inspection; `apply_patch` for modifying or creating test files when no suitable file exists.
- `check_onboarding_performed`, `onboarding`, `find_symbol`, `get_symbols_overview`, `find_referencing_symbols`, `replace_symbol_body`, `insert_before_symbol`, `insert_after_symbol` — from `serena` MCP server *(required for discovering test files and mapping tests to source symbols)*
- `resolve-library-id`, `query-docs` — from `context7` MCP server *(optional, for verifying testing framework API — jest, vitest, pytest, etc.)*
- `sequentialthinking` — from `sequential-thinking` MCP server *(optional, for choosing test strategy: unit vs integration vs e2e)*

Fallbacks follow the global MCP rules. Without Serena, use Glob/Grep/Read for test discovery. Without sequential-thinking, choose the test strategy inline.

Graceful degradation: ✅ Possible — core test debugging works with bash + read + `apply_patch`.

## Steps

### Step 1 — Discover test structure

Find test files and understand the test setup:

1. Use Glob to locate test files and small manifest reads to identify the testing framework:
   - JavaScript/TypeScript: `**/*.{test,spec}.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}`, then read `package.json` test scripts.
   - Python: `tests/**/*.py`, `**/test_*.py`, then read `pytest.ini`, `pyproject.toml`, or `tox.ini` if present.
   - Go: `**/*_test.go`, then read the closest `go.mod`.
   - Rust: `**/*.rs` with test modules or `tests/**/*.rs`, then read `Cargo.toml`.

2. Call `check_onboarding_performed`. If false, call `onboarding`.

3. Call `get_symbols_overview` on relevant test files to see test structure
   (describe blocks, test functions, setup/teardown, shared fixtures).

4. Call `find_symbol` on the test name or describe block if the user mentioned a specific test.

5. If the user mentions "missing test" or "write tests for X": call `find_symbol`
   on the source code symbol that needs tests, then `find_referencing_symbols`
   to see if it already has tests.

**Goal**: know the framework, the test file structure, and the relationship between tests and source code.

---

### Step 2 — Identify task type

Pick the branch that matches the work:

- **Branch A — Failing test**: a test is red and the user wants it green.
- **Branch B — write tests**: TDD or filling a coverage gap with new tests.
- **Branch C — Evaluate coverage**: report on what is and isn't covered, then recommend (and optionally write) the highest-value missing tests.

Use `sequentialthinking` for branch selection only if the user's request is genuinely ambiguous (e.g. "make my tests better"). Otherwise pick from `$ARGUMENTS` directly.

---

### Step 3 — Branch A: Fix failing test

1. Read the exact failing test output via bash. If the user provided a command, run that command. Otherwise run the narrowest discoverable test target. Capture full output under `/tmp/opencode/b-skills/b-test/`; if it exceeds tool limits, read the captured output around the failure location instead of truncating with `tail`:
    ```bash
    mkdir -p /tmp/opencode/b-skills/b-test
    npm test -- --testNamePattern="test name" 2>&1 | tee /tmp/opencode/b-skills/b-test/test-output.log
    # or
    mkdir -p /tmp/opencode/b-skills/b-test
    pytest path/to/test.py::test_function -x 2>&1 | tee /tmp/opencode/b-skills/b-test/test-output.log
    ```
2. Read the failing test code with `read` (narrow section, not full file).
3. Read the source code under test (the function/class being tested).
4. Identify the gap between expected and actual:

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| Wrong expected value | Update the assertion only after confirming the source behavior is correct from requirements, docs, or existing behavior |
| Missing mock | Add mock/stub for the dependency |
| Leaking state | Reset state in `beforeEach` or `afterEach` |
| Async timing | Add `await`, return promise, or use `waitFor` |
| Wrong test data | Provide realistic input matching the scenario |
| Snapshot/golden drift | Regenerate only after confirming the rendered/output behavior is intentionally changed |
| Fixture drift | Update shared fixtures only when all consumers still represent valid scenarios |
| Real bug in production code | Hand off to **b-debug** unless the root cause is already confirmed and the production fix is minimal |

Apply the minimal fix. Prefer `replace_symbol_body` for whole test functions over line-level `apply_patch`.

---

### Step 4 — Branch B: write tests

1. Identify what behavior needs testing:
   - From a plan file → read the acceptance criteria.
   - From `$ARGUMENTS` → parse the behavior description.
   - From source code → read the source symbol, list its branches and edge cases.
2. Use `sequentialthinking` to choose strategy *only if ambiguous*:
   - Pure function → unit test
   - DB interaction → integration test
   - User workflow → e2e (delegate to /b-e2e) or integration test
3. Cover:
    - **Happy path** (normal input → expected output)
    - **Edge cases** (empty input, boundary values, null/undefined)
    - **Error path** (invalid input → error thrown/rejected)
    - **Regression prevention** (would catch a revert of the current change)
    - **Fixtures/golden data** when the project uses them — keep fixtures minimal and local to the behavior unless a shared fixture already exists for the scenario
4. Insert tests using Serena where possible:
   - `insert_after_symbol` / `insert_before_symbol` — add tests within an existing describe block.
   - `apply_patch` — only when no suitable test file exists in the conventional location or a small insertion is clearer than a symbol-level edit.

**Framework-specific conventions**:
- Jest/Vitest: `describe/it`, `beforeEach`, `mock()`
- Pytest: `def test_*`, fixtures, `monkeypatch`
- Go: `Test*` with `t.Run`, `assert.Equal`
- Rust: `#[test]`, `assert_eq!`

---

### Step 5 — Branch C: Evaluate coverage

1. Discover the project's coverage command before running anything:
   - Prefer package scripts (`package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `tox.ini`, `Makefile`, `justfile`, CI config) that already mention coverage.
   - If no coverage command exists, derive the narrowest conventional command for the detected framework and label it as inferred.
   - Do not install tools or assume optional tools such as `cargo tarpaulin` are available unless the project already uses them.
2. Identify uncovered branches/lines, prioritized by:
   - Symbols implementing explicit requirements
   - Symbols at service boundaries
   - Symbols with the broadest references (`find_referencing_symbols`)
3. Report the gap: file → uncovered branch → why it matters.
4. Optionally write the top 1–3 missing tests using the Branch B flow. Ask the user before committing to a long batch.

---

### Step 6 — Run and verify

1. Run the specific test(s) via bash. Prefer the exact command from the failure, project scripts, or the narrowest framework target over the full suite during the fix loop:
   ```bash
   npm test -- --testNamePattern="test name"
   pytest path/to/test.py::test_function
   go test -run TestFunction ./pkg
   cargo test test_function
   ```
2. Confirm the test passes.
3. For new tests: run the narrow test first, then run the broader suite only when the change touches shared fixtures/helpers, public behavior, or the project has a fast standard suite. If skipped, state why.
4. If tests fail: go back to the relevant branch. Maximum 3 iterations.

## Rules

- Never modify production code to make a test pass unless the production code is actually buggy.
- A failing test often reveals a bug in production code → if root cause is not already confirmed, hand off to **b-debug** rather than patching production code from test output alone.
- Never update an assertion just because it is red. First confirm the expected behavior from requirements, existing contracts, or source behavior.
- Keep test fixes minimal — if one assertion is wrong, fix that assertion; do not rewrite the entire test suite.
- Write behavior tests (assert on output), not implementation tests (assert on internal state).
- Use `sequentialthinking` for test strategy decisions only if the choice is genuinely ambiguous.
- If test output exceeds tool limits: capture full output under `/tmp/opencode/b-skills/b-test/`, then read around the failure location instead of truncating with `tail`.
- Prefer running specific tests over the full suite during debugging — faster feedback loop.
