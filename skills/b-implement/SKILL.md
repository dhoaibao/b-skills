description: >
  Execute approved plans safely. ALWAYS invoke when the user says "implement", "execute plan", "thực hiện", "làm theo plan", or after /b-plan approval with a scoped plan. Reads `.opencode/b-plans/` or an approved chat plan, applies steps one at a time, verifies each step, and stops for new decisions. Unlike b-plan (decide), b-implement changes code.

# b-implement

$ARGUMENTS

Execute an approved plan with discipline: read the source of truth, apply the next
small step, verify it, update progress, and stop when a new decision is required.

If `$ARGUMENTS` is provided, treat it as the plan file path, task slug, or explicitly
approved chat-plan description. Do not ask the user to restate the plan unless the
referenced plan cannot be found, approval is unclear, or the implementation target is
ambiguous.

## When to use

- A `/b-plan` chat plan or saved `.opencode/b-plans/[task-slug].md` has been approved.
- User says: "implement", "execute plan", "carry out the plan", "thực hiện", "làm theo plan" with an approved or clearly scoped implementation source.
- The task is already scoped and accepted, and the next action is to modify code or docs.
- You need a disciplined step-by-step executor that verifies each completed step.

## When NOT to use

- Scope, acceptance criteria, or implementation approach is still unclear -> use **b-plan**.
- Broad "build this" or feature requests without an approved/scoped plan -> use **b-plan**.
- Something is broken at runtime -> use **b-debug**.
- The requested change is a concrete rename/extract/move/inline/delete -> use **b-refactor**.
- The task is only to write or fix tests -> use **b-test**.
- The task is only external docs or API lookup -> use **b-research**.

## Tools required

- `bash` — inspect git status/diff and run verification commands.
- `check_onboarding_performed`, `onboarding`, `find_symbol`, `get_symbols_overview`, `find_referencing_symbols`, `find_declaration`, `find_implementations`, `get_diagnostics_for_file`, `replace_symbol_body`, `insert_before_symbol`, `insert_after_symbol`, `rename_symbol`, `safe_delete_symbol` — from `serena` MCP server *(preferred for symbol discovery and code edits)*.
- `resolve-library-id`, `query-docs` — from `context7` MCP server *(optional, for narrow library/API checks discovered during implementation)*.
- `sequentialthinking` — from `sequential-thinking` MCP server *(optional, for resolving step-order ambiguity or failure triage)*.
- `gitnexus` — from `gitnexus` MCP server *(optional radar for high-risk shared/exported symbol checks and post-change scope validation — only when indexed and fresh)*.

Fallbacks follow the global MCP rules. If context7 cannot resolve a library/API uncertainty, use `/b-research`; if GitNexus fails its gate, skip it and continue with Serena/native checks.

Graceful degradation: ✅ Possible — implementation can proceed with native file tools, but broad symbol changes are riskier without Serena.

## Steps

### Step 1 — Load the source of truth

Resolve the implementation source in this order:

1. `$ARGUMENTS` points to a `.md` file -> read that plan.
2. `$ARGUMENTS` names a slug -> read `.opencode/b-plans/[slug].md`.
3. `$ARGUMENTS` contains a complete chat plan and explicitly says it is approved -> use that text directly.
4. `$ARGUMENTS` contains a small, clearly scoped direct implementation request -> proceed, but record the interpreted scope before editing.
5. No usable source -> if the request is broad, multi-file, or unclear, switch to **b-plan**. Otherwise ask: "Which approved plan should I implement? Provide a `.opencode/b-plans/...` path, task slug, or paste the approved chat plan."

Extract:
- Confirmed decisions.
- Planned touch points.
- Ordered steps and dependencies.
- Each step's `Done when` verification.
- Unknowns that must be resolved before coding.

If the plan contains unresolved `Need decision` items, ask the user before editing.

---

### Step 2 — Check working state

Run `git status --short` and inspect only the files relevant to the current step.

- If unrelated files are dirty: leave them alone.
- If a planned file already has unrelated edits: read the affected section carefully and preserve those edits.
- If user edits directly conflict with the planned change: stop and ask how to proceed.

Choose the next unchecked or unimplemented step whose dependencies are complete. Work on one step at a time.

---

### Step 3 — Implement one step

For code changes, initialize Serena project knowledge first: call `check_onboarding_performed`; if onboarding has not been performed, call `onboarding` once.

Follow this order:

1. Locate the named symbol or file from the plan.
2. Use `get_symbols_overview` before opening large source files.
3. Use `find_declaration` when the plan names a call site, imported helper, or method usage but not the owning definition.
4. Use `find_implementations` when the step targets an interface, abstract method, or polymorphic boundary.
5. Use `find_referencing_symbols` when the step changes exported/shared behavior.
6. Optionally call `gitnexus_impact` when GitNexus passes the global gate and the step changes a shared/exported boundary; confirm with Serena references.
7. Apply the smallest edit that satisfies the step.
8. Do not add unplanned abstractions, features, cleanup, or compatibility code.

Use `rename_symbol`, `safe_delete_symbol`, and other refactor-oriented tools only when the approved plan explicitly calls for that mechanical transformation. If implementation reveals an unplanned rename, move, extract, inline, or delete, switch to **b-refactor** instead of folding it into the feature step.

If implementation reveals a new behavioral/product decision, stop and ask. Do not self-infer.

---

### Step 4 — Verify the step

Run the exact `Done when` command from the plan when available. If the plan lacks a command, run the narrowest relevant check for the touched area.

Before broader commands, call `get_diagnostics_for_file` on touched source files when the language tooling supports it. Fix obvious syntax or type issues locally first.

Classify failures:
- Implementation mistake -> fix within the current step and rerun the check.
- Test setup/assertion/mocking issue -> use **b-test**.
- Runtime/root-cause uncertainty -> use **b-debug**.
- Library/API uncertainty -> use `context7`; if unresolved, use **b-research**.

Use the global 3-iteration fix/verify cap per step. After that, report what passed, what failed, and the remaining evidence.

---

### Step 5 — Record progress

After verification passes:

- If using a saved plan file, mark the completed checkbox for that step.
- Note any verification command and result in the final response.
- Keep the git diff limited to the current plan scope.

Then continue to the next dependency-ready step until all planned steps are complete or a blocker appears.

---

### Step 6 — Final pass

Before reporting completion:

1. Inspect `git diff` to confirm only planned files changed.
2. Run the final verification command from the plan, if present.
3. If the implementation is non-trivial, recommend `/b-review` before commit or PR.
4. **Optional changed-scope validation** *(only when GitNexus passes the global gate and the implementation touched shared/exported boundaries or broad flows)*: call `gitnexus_detect_changes`; otherwise rely on diff inspection and Serena references.

Do not commit unless the user explicitly requested a commit.

## Rules

- Implement only approved scope. If scope is unclear, go back to `/b-plan`.
- Broad work needs a saved plan, approved chat plan, or explicit approval statement. Do not treat a loose feature description as implementation-ready.
- Work one plan step at a time and verify before moving on.
- Never overwrite unrelated user changes.
- Never invent missing requirements or product decisions.
- Prefer symbol-aware edits for code and minimal apply_patch-style edits for prose/config.
- Do not refactor opportunistically while implementing a feature step.
