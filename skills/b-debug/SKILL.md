  Systematic hypothesis-driven debugging. ALWAYS invoke when the user reports
  a runtime bug, an error, broken behavior, slow path, memory issue, or
  pastes a stack trace. Traces execution, confirms root cause, then fixes
  minimally and verifies. Unlike b-test, b-debug owns runtime behavior
  failures, not test-mechanic issues such as wrong assertions, mocks, or

# b-debug

$ARGUMENTS

Confirm root cause, fix minimally, verify, and remove probes. If the user asks only for diagnosis, stop after root cause and proposed fix.

## When to use

- The user reports a runtime bug, broken behavior, error, stack trace, race, memory issue, or slowdown.
- A test likely exposes a real product bug under the global test-vs-bug decision.
- The failure may cross middleware, async boundaries, configuration, or multiple modules.

## When NOT to use

- The problem is a test assertion, mock, fixture, or setup issue -> use **b-test**.
- The task is external docs/API lookup only -> use **b-research**.
- The task is new scoped work -> use **b-plan** or **b-implement**.

## Tools required

- `serena-symbol-toolkit` *(preferred for tracing and focused fixes)*
- `gitnexus-radar` *(optional, for unfamiliar cross-module paths)*
- `context7-docs` *(optional, for suspected API misuse)*
- `brave-discovery` + `firecrawl-extraction` *(optional, for public errors after the privacy gate)*
- Native search and `bash` - exact errors, config, repro commands, profilers, and diagnostics.

Fallbacks: `AGENTS.md` section 4. Graceful degradation: possible with native analysis, slower without Serena.

## Steps

### Step 1 - Frame the symptom

Collect exact failure, expected vs actual behavior, repro notes, determinism, and for perf bugs workload/baseline/threshold.

For non-trivial or blocked bugs, keep a repro record: command or interaction, workspace or target, relevant versions/config flags, expected behavior, actual behavior, determinism, and strongest evidence. Do not include secret values or private data.

If production impact, data loss, or security risk is active, identify the safest containment first and ask before shared-environment action.

### Step 2 - Rank suspects only as needed

Use the stack trace or diagnostic fast path when one file/function is already strongly implicated. Otherwise map the path with the lightest tool: GitNexus for unfamiliar graph-shaped flows, then Serena/native reads for exact owners and references.

Bias first checks toward swallowed errors, auth/authz gates, config drift, missing `await`, async ordering, shared-state leaks, and new boundary errors. For perf, measure N+1 queries, unbounded retries, hot-loop allocations, or blocking I/O before guessing.

### Step 3 - Confirm root cause

Use the cheapest proof: exact error search, local diagnostics, narrow repro command, targeted docs lookup, benchmark/profiler, forced ordering, fake clock, or stress loop.

Temporary probes are allowed only when cheaper evidence is insufficient. Use instrumentation when the symptom is intermittent, remote-only, timing-dependent, or hidden behind swallowed errors and a bounded probe can collect decisive evidence; otherwise request the missing repro data or hand off to **b-plan** for structural diagnosis work. Tag every probe with `b-debug-probe` in the language-appropriate comment form.

If the agent cannot reproduce a user-reproducible symptom, follow the global cannot-reproduce protocol and do not patch defensively.

Before editing, state: `Root cause: <what fails> because <why>`.

### Step 4 - Apply the minimal fix

Use Serena for symbol edits and `apply_patch` for small line/prose/config fixes under the global patch discipline. If `apply_patch` reports missing expected lines, treat it as stale context: re-read and retry with smaller verified context.

Do not bundle cleanup or redesign. If the confirmed cause needs a structural change, hand off to **b-plan** with root cause, evidence, and any attempted minimal fix.

### Step 5 - Verify and clean up

Run the narrowest check that proves the symptom changed. For nondeterminism, run the stress repro long enough to support confidence. For perf, report before/after measurements.

Remove all `b-debug-probe` markers and scan for untagged debug leftovers (`console.log`, `print`, breakpoints, fake clocks, profiler hooks). Re-run verification after cleanup. Mention restart/reload requirements when config or startup changed.

## Output format

```text
Symptoms -> Root cause -> Fix -> Verification -> Cleanup/next
```

## Rules

- Do not patch before root cause is confirmed.
- Measure perf bugs before and after.
- Surface cannot-reproduce gaps instead of speculative fixes.
- Use global patch discipline, stale context recovery, verification ladder, iteration cap, and skipped-check labels.
- Verify probe removal before reporting success.

## Reference pointers

- `references/performance-checklist.md` - use when a slowdown spans layers or lacks a clear measurement playbook.
