  Systematic hypothesis-driven debugging. ALWAYS invoke when the user reports

  pastes a stack trace. Traces execution, confirms root cause, then fixes
  minimally and verifies. Unlike b-test, b-debug owns runtime behavior
  failures, not test-mechanic issues such as wrong assertions, mocks, or

# b-debug

$ARGUMENTS

Trace, confirm root cause, fix minimally, verify, and remove probes. Do not patch before the cause is explicit.

If `$ARGUMENTS` includes a symptom, error, or stack trace, start from it directly. If the user asked only for diagnosis, stop after the confirmed root cause and proposed fix.

## When to use

- The user reports a runtime bug, broken behavior, or error message.
- A test likely exposes a real product bug rather than a test harness issue (`AGENTS.md` §10).
- The failure path may cross middleware, async boundaries, configuration, or multiple modules.
- The bug is non-deterministic (flake, race, time/network dependence) and the test lane has ruled out fixture or harness drift.
- The symptom is **slow**, not wrong — latency regression, memory leak, runaway CPU, or unbounded growth.

## When NOT to use

- The problem is clearly a test assertion, mock, fixture, or setup issue → use **b-test**.
- The task is external docs or API lookup only → use **b-research**.
- The task is a new feature or scoped implementation request → use **b-plan** or **b-implement**.

## Tools required

- `serena-symbol-toolkit` *(preferred for tracing and focused fixes)*
- `gitnexus-radar` *(optional radar for unfamiliar cross-module paths)*
- `context7-docs` *(optional, for suspected library/API misuse)*
- `brave-discovery` + `firecrawl-extraction` *(optional, for known public errors; honor `AGENTS.md` §6 privacy gate)*
- Native search and `bash` — exact error strings, config keys, repeated patterns, narrow source reads, reproduction commands, profilers.

Fallbacks: `AGENTS.md` §4. Graceful degradation: ✅ Possible — native analysis works, but cross-file tracing is slower without Serena.

## Steps

### Step 1 — Frame the symptom

Collect only the needed start state: exact failure, expected vs actual, repro notes, determinism, and for perf bugs workload/baseline/threshold.

If the bug is currently production-impacting or risks data loss/security exposure, take a mitigation-first branch: identify the safest immediate containment option (disable path, rollback candidate, feature flag, traffic drain, or user-visible workaround), ask for approval before any shared-environment action, then continue root-cause analysis from the contained state.

If a stack trace or diagnostic already points at one function or file, mark it as a **fast path** and go directly to Step 3.

### Step 2 — Map the path and rank suspects

Use `gitnexus-radar` only when the path is unfamiliar, graph-shaped, or route/consumer oriented. Stop once the likely subsystem or boundary is identified.

Then use `serena-symbol-toolkit` to confirm owners, references, and code shape. Pick the cheapest discovery tool that closes the next question (`AGENTS.md` §4).

**First-suspect heuristic:** swallowed errors, auth/authz gates, config drift, async ordering/missing `await`, shared-state leaks, new boundary errors; for perf, N+1 queries, unbounded retries, hot-loop allocations, blocking I/O.

For non-deterministic bugs, enumerate the candidate non-determinism sources first (shared state, async ordering, time, network, randomness, environment).

Rank remaining hypotheses by likelihood × cheapest verification. Example: a "config default flipped" hypothesis (verifiable in one `grep`) outranks a "race in worker pool" hypothesis (requires stress harness) even when the race is slightly more likely — verify the cheap one first, then move on. Skip ranking when the fast path already isolates one cause.

### Step 3 — Confirm root cause cheaply

Start with the cheapest verification:
- Search the codebase for the exact error string or log text.
- For library/framework errors, check `context7-docs` for exact API/option behavior.
- For known public errors, optionally use `brave-discovery` + `firecrawl-extraction` after honoring the privacy gate (`AGENTS.md` §6).
- Local diagnostics: `get_diagnostics_for_file`.
- A narrow repro command already in the project.
- Targeted temporary logging at one choke point. **Tag every temporary probe** with the exact marker `// b-debug-probe` (or the language-appropriate comment form, e.g., `# b-debug-probe`, `<!-- b-debug-probe -->`) so probes are greppable at cleanup time and cannot survive accidentally.
- For perf bugs: profiler, `time`/`hyperfine`, runtime tracing, or a tight benchmark — never guess from code shape alone.
- For non-deterministic bugs: forced ordering, fake clock, stress loop. Repro must demonstrate the failure under conditions you control before claiming root cause.

If the symptom **cannot be reproduced** by the agent, follow the **agent-cannot-reproduce protocol** in `AGENTS.md` §10: do not patch, capture the environment diff, and ask for the specific signals listed there (command sequence, logs, env, repro snippet) before continuing.

State the root cause explicitly before editing:

`Root cause: <what fails> because <why>` (extend with conditions when the bug only fires under Z).

### Step 4 — Apply the minimal fix

Keep the fix narrow:
- Use Serena for symbol-scoped edits, `apply_patch` for small line fixes under the patch discipline in `AGENTS.md` §6, and comments only when the fix is non-obvious.
- If `apply_patch` reports missing expected lines, treat it as stale context; re-read the current target slice and retry only with verified smaller context.

Do not roll broader cleanup or unrelated refactors into the bug fix.

**Redesign hand-off:** if the confirmed root cause requires a structural change (new abstraction, contract change, ordering rework across modules) rather than a localized fix, stop. Emit a handoff envelope (`AGENTS.md` §9) to **b-plan** with the root-cause statement, evidence, and the minimal-fix attempted (if any). Do not silently expand a debug pass into a redesign.

### Step 5 — Verify and remove probes

1. Run the narrowest relevant command that proves the symptom changed.
2. For non-deterministic bugs, also run the stress repro from Step 3 long enough to gain confidence the race no longer triggers.
3. For perf bugs, re-run the benchmark and report the before/after delta, not just "feels faster."
4. **Re-scan the diff** for every temporary probe added during Step 3. First grep for the `b-debug-probe` tag across the diff and remove every match. Then re-scan for untagged probes (`console.log`, `print`, breakpoints, extra metrics, debug flags, fake clocks, profiler hooks) and remove anything that was not part of the final fix. Re-run verification after removal.
5. If the fix affects config or process startup, tell the user whether a restart or reload is required.
6. If the fix touched several files or a shared boundary, emit a handoff envelope (`AGENTS.md` §9) recommending **b-review**.

Apply the verification ladder and iteration cap from `AGENTS.md` §7.

Close with the skill-exit status block (`AGENTS.md` §9).

## Rules

- Never patch before confirming root cause.
- Use the obvious-stack-trace fast path when one file or function is already strongly implicated.
- For perf bugs, measure before and after; do not infer speed from code structure.
- For cannot-reproduce reports, stop and surface the gap; do not speculate-fix.
- For active production impact, prefer approved containment before deep investigation; do not mutate shared environments without the approval gate in `AGENTS.md` §6.
- Verify probe removal explicitly before reporting success.
- Attach the confidence signal (`AGENTS.md` §3) when the fix relies on indirect or partial evidence.

## Reference pointers

- `references/performance-checklist.md` (installed under `~/.config/opencode/references/b-skills/`) — use when a slowdown spans multiple layers or the repo lacks a clear measurement playbook.

## Common rationalizations

See the suite-wide anti-pattern table in `AGENTS.md` §12. Debug-specific reminders: state `Root cause: <what> because <why>` before editing, remove every `b-debug-probe` before reporting success, and never defensive-patch a cannot-reproduce report.
